Think of them as roleplaying tools that you can use to help guide your PC's actions during the campaign. These traits do, however, have an impact on the adventures: in certain parts of Curtain Call, characters with specific persona traits will be particularly well-suited to face certain challenges and will gain one-time boons and bonuses that help them navigate the encounter in question.
