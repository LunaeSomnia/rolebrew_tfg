She makes new friends as swiftly as she strikes with her rapier, and while she has a flair for the dramatic (why merely attack a foe when you can make a show of it with a twirl of the cape or a somersault or two?), she never favors ostentation or glory over the opportunity to help a friend in need. Jirelle understands that the strength of one's relationships with friends, allies, lovers, and family make one strong. It was her mother's failure to forge such bonds that allowed a young Jirelle to escape from a life that would have likely seen offered as sacrifice to the shark demon Ovonovo before the close of her thirteenth birthday.</p>\n<p>On the subject of her mother or her ship, the <em>Bloodcrow</em>, the typically light-hearted half-elf grows serious. Jirelle does not share the secrets of her childhood with just anyone. As such, few know how she engineered the sinking of the <em>Bloodcrow</em> and the death of her wretched elven mother off the coast of Tempest Cay. Jirelle often jokes that she befriends for life, with the playful, only slightly malicious glint in her eyes implying what might happen to those who would betray such friendship.</p>\n<p>After escaping the <em>Bloodcrow</em>, Jirelle spent some time surviving as a street rat in the alleys of Drenchport. Armed with a fine rapier and clad in her her mother's magical cloak (the only two things she managed to escape the <em>Bloodcrow</em>'s wreckage with), Jirelle kept every coin and bauble she earned in a thrice-locked chest she keeps well hidden and protected. At first, she'd hoped to save enough money to afford a move from the Shackles to distant Taldor, drawn by tales of a land where duels and extravagance and civility promised a better life. But when rumors of a strange, ghostly ship plying the sea-ways of the Shackles reached her-fearful stories of a vessel commanded by an imperious banshee and bound by undeath-Jirelle realized that in sinking the <em>Bloodcrow</em> she'd done the exact opposite of what she'd intended. Rather than spare the Shackles of a brutal pirate queen, she'd unleashed an even deadlier scourge upon the Fever Sea.</p>\n<p>Today, Jirelle seeks the funds to someday finance a ship and crew of her own. She plans not to become a pirate-for a life of plunder and cruelty holds no appeal for the daring swashbuckler-but to finish the job she started on the eve of her thirteenth birthday. Jirelle knows she can't do this on her own, though.

you revere above all others. The most common deities in Pathfinder appear on pages 35–39 of Player Core, along with their edicts, areas of concern, and the benefits you get for being a devotee of that deity. Choose one deity.</p><h2>Skill</h2><p>You become trained in the divine skill listed for your deity. As normal, if you're already trained in that skill, you become trained in a different skill of your choice.</p><h2>Anathema</h2><p>Champions care deeply about the edicts and anathema they take from their deity, sanctification, and cause. As with any implementation of edicts and anathema in the rules, these are a tool for roleplaying between you, the GM, and the other players at the table—you're still playing a nuanced character, not strictly following a script.</p>\n<p>Acts fundamentally opposed to your deity's ideals are anathema to your faith. Learning or casting spells, committing acts, and using items that are anathema to your deity remove you from your deity's good graces.</p>\n<p>Similarly, using items, spells, or actions that are anathema to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your connection to your deity. For example, assisting with a ritual that raises undead would be anathema to Pharasma, the goddess of death. Many actions that are anathema don't appear in any deity's formal list. For borderline cases, you and your GM determine which acts are anathema.</p>\n<p>If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. The class features that you lose are determined by the GM, but they likely include your holy or unholy trait, your focus pool, and your blessing of the devoted. These abilities can be regained only if you repent by conducting an atone ritual. If your deity doesn't require the specific sanctification you had, your GM might let you retrain your sanctification and cause while still following the same deity.</p><h2>Sanctification</h2><p>Depending on your deity, their sanctification can make you holy or unholy. This commits you to one side of a struggle over souls. Whether you become holy, unholy, or neither will limit your choice of causes, devotion spells, and feats.</p>\n<p>If you \"can be\" holy or unholy according to your deity's sanctification entry, you make that choice, and if you \"must be\" holy or unholy, you gain the trait automatically. If the deity lists \"none,\" you can choose only options that don't require the holy or unholy trait. If you are holy or unholy and gain the opposing trait in some way, you lose the previous trait until you atone.</p>\n<p>Unholy sanctification for a champion can be extremely disruptive to a typical game and should be a player character option only in appropriate adventures or campaigns where the group collectively decides to embrace them.

Certainly her numerous orders of paladins have risen swiftly to take on the vaunted role of paragon in many societies. Evangelical in their exuberance to spread word of her wisdom, Iomedae's missionaries were pivotal in the defense during the fabled Siege of Solku. They sacrificed their lives saving the town from gnoll slavers, and although none of them survived the siege, their presence lived on. Particularly in the eyes of young Seelah.</p>\n<p>Seelah's family came to the walled town of Solku as pilgrims fleeing the atrocities of distant Geb to the distant south. Unfortunately, they traded one peril for another, and within months of their settling in Solku, the gnolls of White Canyon began their infamous pillaging. Seelah's parents were slain in the first of these raids, leaving her orphaned at the age of 14 in a strange town. She did what she must to survive on the city streets, pickpocketing and bullying and even hiring herself out as a mercenary. When a group of Iomedae's knights arrived to defend Solku, Seelah was immediately taken with their beautiful, shining armor, and within an hour she had stolen a particularly fine mithral helm with a golden bird upon its brow. Yet then, something strange happened—Seelah became overwhelmed with guilt at her theft. For days, she agonized over the act, trying (and failing) several times to pawn the helm. During the Battle of Red Hail, Seelah realized that one of the bravest knights, a woman named Acemi with hair in long braids, fought the battle without her helm. This was the woman's undoing—in holding Solku's gates, she took a mortal wound to the skull from a gnoll's flail. The woman's heroism carried the day, but that evening she died of her wound.</p>\n<p>Wracked with guilt, Seelah approached Acemi's body as her companions prepared for her pyre. They watched silently as Seelah placed the stolen helm over the dead woman's head, and then climbed onto the pyre aside her to join her in death. The paladins were moved beyond words—they had known from the start that Seelah had stolen the helm, but Acemi had forbidden her brothers and sisters from collecting it, hoping that the helm would bring the desperate orphan enough money to survive for another few months. The knights of Iomedae took Seelah in that night. Although she has come to terms with Acemi's death, Seelah still regrets the theft that ironically brought her into Iomedae's arms.

Travelers by nature, they spent the short northern summers making slow loops through Hagreach and the Thanelands, facilitating trade. What few memories Feiya has of that life are happy ones: the jostling of wagons, the smell of campfires, and wandering alone through fields and forests, marveling as the wildness closed around her.</p>\n<p>That happiness came to a sudden halt on the fateful day that brought her to the attention of a recently sundered coven of witches who dwelled on the border with Irrisen. Led by a particularly cruel green hag named Nysima, the coven had lost its youngest member to a squad of Blackravens from Trollheim and was still reeling from its sudden loss of power. They witnessed the child as she skipped away from the caravan stop, following a family of deer deep into the woods, and immediately set upon her.</p>\n<p>There's no telling what cruelties the witches would have visited upon the girl had they not suffered their recent loss. As it was, another, no less horrific, fate awaited young Feiya. The two crones seized the child and whisked her away to the east, their mad cackling drowning out the young girl's terrified screams. By the time they reached their snow- and thatch-covered huts, they had given the child a new name and were already envisioning the return of their lost powers.</p>\n<p>The next twelve years were a blur of pain, terror, and misery as Feiya endured the crones' sadistic attempts to teach her their dark craft. Alternating between tutelage and torture, the witches frequently let their cruel natures impede their instruction. For while the young girl showed unmistakable promise and aptitude, she also possessed a defiance that only the harshest of punishments could suppress. On numerous occasions, Feiya tried to escape her imprisonment, only to be tracked down and captured after no more than a few hours. The retributions for these failed attempts have scarred her body and mind in ways that no magic can ever heal.</p>\n<p>One brisk autumn day, after being beaten for failing to properly brew a batch of poisonous blue whinnis, Feiya was sent off to gather herbs. While harvesting more whinnis root, she spied a fox watching her from atop a large rime-covered rock. Unlike the region's typical arctic specimens, this creature had a striking red and orange coloration that stood in stark contrast to the endless snow. There was something about the way the creature watched her that beckoned to Feiya. She approached carefully, and was astonished by his calm and focus. As she neared, the fox trotted a small distance away, turned, and gave her a look that was clearly an invitation to follow. This process was repeated again and again, and before she knew it, Feiya was following the fox on another escape attempt.</p>\n<p>By sundown, the two witches had realized Feiya's intentions. Furious, they set off in pursuit, confident that, as with all previous instances, their hunt would be brief. This time, however, Feiya had guidance. The fox led her along trails never before seen by human nor hag, staying always just ahead and out of reach. When she needed nourishment, the fox led her to game and fresh water. When she needed rest, it stood vigil while she slept. In this manner, Feiya was able to elude capture for more than two weeks.</p>\n<p>One particularly cold evening, however, Feiya's luck ran out. With her pursuers hot on her trail and the fox nowhere to be seen, she found herself trapped in a river valley surrounded on three sides by impassable mountains. Feiya could sense the witches closing in, could hear their promises of pain on the chilling wind. She took shelter in a shallow cave behind the waterfall that fed the river, a curious little grotto whose far wall was emblazoned with a crude carving of a butterfly. Like an animal run to ground, Feiya steeled herself for the coming confrontation. She had come too far this time to surrender without a fight. She determined then and there that her days of living under someone else's yoke were over. She would have her freedom, either in this life or the next.</p>\n<p>It was at that moment that the fox reappeared. Only now, there was something different in the way he approached her. He had always shown a preternatural intelligence, but as Feiya stared into his eyes, she saw a consciousness and a determination that would have frightened her had she not come to trust the animal so implicitly. As she watched him, Feiya was startled by a sudden and overwhelming flurry of sensations invading her mind. She sank, dazed, to the cave floor as the feelings slowly crystallized into coherence. Less a voice than a series of emotions, the promise it offered was unmistakable. Feiya said nothing, but her acceptance was as clear as it was quick.</p>\n<p>What followed will forever haunt Feiya's dreams. Raspy promises of pain and suffering rose above the din of the waterfall as the witches drew near to cave mouth. Feiya could see the outlines of their hunched bodies just beyond the blanket of cascading water, but before she could act, another sound arose. It started as a low rumble, then quickly gained volume, drowning out both hags and water and sending tremors through the cave floor. Then the valley erupted with the screeching and roaring of what could only have been a forest's worth of wild animals, punctured occasionally by the shrill curse of a hag.</p>\n<p>Long minutes passed as Feiya stood, too frightened to move. Then, as gradually as it began, the noise subsided until all that remained was the crash of the waterfall. Feiya crouched down behind a rocky outcropping, afraid to leave the shelter of the cave. As the minutes turned into hours, exhaustion claimed her, and, despite her anxiety, she succumbed to a fitful sleep.</p>\n<p>When dawn finally arrived, Feiya stepped out from the cave, not quite sure what she was expecting to see. A fresh blanket of snow had covered the land, hiding any clues she might have found concerning the events of the previous night. Yet the feeling of relief was palpable. The fox crept up and paused at her side. She was finally free.</p>\n<p>Feiya never discusses the events of that night, nor the particulars of the strange pact she entered into. She may one day try to track down the parents she barely remembers, but for now she is content to roam the world, relishing her freedom, seeking new experiences, and developing her newfound power. Though she desperately desires the company of others, formative years spent away from civilized society have left Feiya lacking in social graces, and her awkwardness often leads to unfortunate misunderstandings. Nevertheless, her inherent good nature tends to win out, and her occasional flares of temper are countered by her steadfast loyalty to her friends. Feiya relishes travel, and having identified the butterfly carving in the waterfall cave as the found-mark of a Desnan priest, she gladly embraces that faith, hoping that her wanderings may cast more light on who she really is—and what entity fosters her magical abilities.</p>","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/deity.svg","value":""},"ethnicity":{"value":"Avistan"},"gender":{"value":"F/She/Her"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"languages":{"details":"","value":["aklo","goblin","jotun","skald","tien"]},"level":{"value":5},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"focus":{"value":3},"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":0},"arcana":{"rank":1},"athletics":{"rank":0},"crafting":{"rank":1},"deception":{"rank":0},"diplomacy":{"rank":0},"intimidation":{"rank":0},"medicine":{"rank":2},"nature":{"rank":1},"occultism":{"rank":2},"performance":{"rank":0},"religion":{"rank":1},"society":{"rank":0},"stealth":{"rank":1},"survival":{"rank":1},"thievery":{"rank":1}},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.iconics.Actor.5Z6KUEZPXmVBYLS2"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"6Tl6BATf1u3VcT4c","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/iconics/FumbusFull.webp","items":[{"_id":"1l2npffcrfag31pe","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.backgrounds.Item.j9v38iHA0sVy59SR"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/background.svg","name":"Pathfinder Hopeful","sort":0,"system":{"boosts":{"0":{"selected":"int","value":["con","int"]},"1":{"selected":"dex","value":["cha","con","dex","int","str","wis"]}},"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong> Region - Absalom and Starstone Isle</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've long wanted to join the adventurous Pathfinder Society.

The Chitterwood has been largely left to the goblins since the end of the Goblinblood Wars nearly twenty years ago, its goblin inhabitants now free of the militant influence of their hobgoblin cousins, most of whom were eradicated or driven out of Isger at the closing of the war.</p>\n<p>Fumbus had the honor of serving as apprentice to the Fire-Eater goblin clan's chief pickle-maker, a position which gave him a fair amount of standing amongst his kin. Unfortunately, Fumbus had a particular penchant for experimentation that led to spectacular failures as often as it led to new delicacies. When a particularly unstable batch of \"spicy pickle brine\" exploded in the middle of the Fire-Eater encampment, Fumbus fled the Chitterwood, fearing that the reprisal from his fellow goblins for destroying both the clan's precious pickle barrel and a significant supply of cucumbers would be swift and violent.</p>\n<p>Fumbus's initial forays into the wider world were truly terrifying. Scavenging from human farms usually ended poorly, as vicious dogs and horrifying horses would bite, chase, or stomp the poor goblin if they caught wind of his presence. The humans themselves were often even more terrifying, and Fumbus found himself fleeing pitchfork-wielding mobs with stolen, smelly shoes (easiest to find without a light and useful as either food or clothing) tucked under one arm far more often than he found a safe place to fill his belly and sleep. Fumbus's life likely would have ended at the hands of one of these mobs had he not encountered a passing half-orc Pathfinder named Droven whose initial reaction to the little goblin was humor, rather than fear or violence. Used to dealing with a certain amount of prejudice and distrust himself, Droven dissuaded the mob from pursuing their vendetta against the goblin and allowed Fumbus to accompany him on his mission.</p>\n<p>Droven's heroics entranced young Fumbus, particularly the alchemical fire and other concoctions the half-orc used to defeat his opponents. When Droven completed his mission for the Pathfinder Society, he brought Fumbus back with him to Absalom. Droven helped secure a home for the little goblin in the Puddles district, where Fumbus's presence would be less likely to cause a stir, and shared what he knew of alchemy with the eager goblin. While Fumbus was terrified at the thought of needing to write down formulas, his mind was sharp and he quickly mastered the art of reading; to Fumbus, collecting these foolishly discarded thoughts was no different than surviving off the trash and scraps left on the outskirts of towns and cities. Fumbus came up with his own system for creating and remembering formulas using small tokens engraved with pictographic runes and a series of leather cords, which he would use to bind certain ingredients in specific orders. Together these implements allowed him to practice alchemy without risking his goblin soul or precious thoughts by performing the obscene act of writing anything down. Of further benefit to Fumbus, his new home's location in the Puddles allows the little goblin to experiment with all manner of inflammable and unstable concoctions with little fear of wreaking destruction beyond the building's water-logged rooms.</p>\n<p>Droven offered to sponsor Fumbus into the Pathfinder Society, but the goblin was so impressed by Droven that he truly believed he would not be able to pass the Society's rigorous entry exams. Determined to prove himself, Fumbus busily applied his time and energy to creating new alchemical formulas and perfecting his system for recording his discoveries. As Fumbus's confidence grew, he began to believe that perhaps he might find a place in the Pathfinder Society after all. Skulking through the alleys of Absalom, Fumbus made his way to the Grand Lodge. Upon his arrival, Fumbus learned that Droven had left on a mission several weeks ago and was overdue to report in; his ship was believed lost at sea. Droven had left a letter of sponsorship as well as some funds to secure the goblin a chance to learn at the Society's institutions but Fumbus was unwilling to begin his training without the half-orc present.</p>\n<p>Months have passed and Droven has still not returned. Fumbus spends his time perfecting his alchemy, seeking news of his lost friend, and looking for opportunities to ingratiate himself to the Pathfinder Society, despite multiple assurances from the Society's members and leadership that Fumbus's welcome was already secured by his half-orc friend. Something in Fumbus's mind refuses to let go of the idea that he must prove himself to be a worthy explorer of the same caliber as Droven, whose heroics and skill are unmatched in Fumbus's view. The little goblin has made a decision that he holds sacrosanct: he will earn his entrance to the Society by either finding his friend Droven and bringing the half-orc home, or by performing a truly heroic act worthy of the reputation Droven holds in Fumbus's own eyes.</p>","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/deity.svg","value":""},"ethnicity":{"value":""},"gender":{"value":"M/He/Him"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"languages":{"details":"","value":["draconic","jotun","orcish","osiriani"]},"level":{"value":3},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"crafting":{"infusedReagents":{"value":2}},"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":1},"arcana":{"rank":0},"athletics":{"rank":1},"crafting":{"rank":2},"deception":{"rank":0},"diplomacy":{"rank":1},"intimidation":{"rank":0},"medicine":{"rank":1},"nature":{"rank":0},"occultism":{"rank":0},"performance":{"rank":0},"religion":{"rank":0},"society":{"rank":0},"stealth":{"rank":1},"survival":{"rank":1},"thievery":{"rank":1}},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.iconics.Actor.6Tl6BATf1u3VcT4c"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"aEjJRh8Ru91DfVVN","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/iconics/AmiriFull.webp","items":[{"_id":"ERgsYE6JqjO71Dgd","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/lore.svg","name":"Tanning Lore","sort":0,"system":{"description":{"value":""},"mod":{"value":0},"proficient":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"lore","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"Bngl6q30kXWZ1FGa","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.hFBwsVcSnNCJoimo"},"pf2e":{"itemGrants":{"diehard":{"id":"9G79A4F3aNyocva7","onDelete":"detach"}}}},"img":"icons/environment/people/group.webp","name":"Versatile Heritage","sort":0,"system":{"ancestry":{"name":"Human","slug":"human","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.ancestries.Item.IiG7DgeLWYrSNXuX"},"description":{"value":"<p>Humanity's versatility and ambition have fueled its ascendance to be the most common ancestry in most nations throughout the world.

The natives of this brutal land are the nomadic Kellids, and they have made the best of this primal world. Amiri is one of these barbarians. Although she was blessed with a combination of independence and brawn, Amiri's childhood remained one of constant challenge. To the people of her tribe, the Six Bears, brawn and bravery were not ideal characteristics for a woman to have. To the Six Bears, a woman's role was simple—raise children, tend to the sick, and forge bonds with other tribes. Women were resources. When a tribe wished to form an alliance, they would send gifts of meat, furs, treasure, and daughters. Amiri didn't see herself as livestock, and every chance she got, she tried to one-up her brothers and cousins. When a hunter went out and caught a caribou for the tribe, she would go out and catch two. When a party of orc raiders stumbled into their hunting grounds and a tribal hero killed four, she took it upon herself to kill six. Her constant sense of competition made her few friends—her brothers were both intimidated by her ferocity and enthralled by her beauty, while her sisters knew that each time she went against tradition, they would all be punished.</p>\n<p>When Amiri finally came of age, her reputation had spread beyond the Six Bears. The other tribes took to calling her the \"Soft Chieftain\" of the Six Bears, a name that humiliated her almost as much as it did her kin, inferring that they were weak for allowing one of their women to grow so independent and strong. None of the other tribes wanted any part of her—her continued presence among the Six Bears caused much strife between once friendly tribes, and so the elders determined that there was but one choice—Amiri had to die. The only problem was the commonly held belief that murder of one's kin was the greatest taboo and the surest path to Hell.</p>\n<p>The opportunity to be rid of their troublesome sister rose soon enough, when word came of a tribe of frost giants who had been sighted in the nearby mountains. The elders organized a warband to scout the mountains and to drive back the giants, and they made sure that Amiri was included in the band. Shocked but proud to have finally been chosen, Amiri didn't notice how the elders smiled at her eagerness to be on her way. The elders knew that Amiri's sense of competition would swiftly get her in over her head, and in secret tasked the rest of the hunters to goad her into just such a situation.</p>\n<p>The warband headed up into the Kodar foothills, and it wasn't long before they found evidence of giants. One morning, the leader of the band rushed into camp, waving a dagger the size of a man's arm over his head. The warrior claimed to have single-handedly slain a giant and to have taken his dagger, and the others in the band congratulated him on his skill and bravery. Amiri took the bait, and announced that she would return by sundown with an even greater weapon. She could have no way of knowing that the dagger was part of the deception—that the warband had brought it with them as a prop to incite her into a foolish plan.</p>\n<p>What the warband themselves didn't anticipate was that Amiri would find a frost giant. After wandering the mountains, she came to an immense body at the foot of a cliff—the giant had fallen to his death weeks before, and at his side lay his immense bastard sword. Although Amiri knew that she had not killed the giant, she also knew that all she needed was his sword as proof—certainly her kin wouldn't think to dispute her claim with such a grand trophy. Yet when she returned to the place she had left her kin, she found the camp empty. Concerned, worried that they had fallen victim to the region's dangers, she tracked them, catching up with the warband halfway back to the tribal camp. As she approached the camp, though, she realized something was amiss—they were talking of her, and they were laughing.</p>\n<p>Creeping unseen to the edge of the camp, she realized that she had been duped. She heard her kin mocking her ways, of how she had fallen for their ruse, and how even now she was likely cooking in a giant's stewpot. That they seemed grateful and so at ease with her death was not what enraged Amiri. It was the proof that her own people thought of her as a fool that did it. Eyes blazing, Amiri stepped into the camp and held her new sword out, proclaiming that even now she had bested them. The other warriors, shocked to see her alive, quickly fell back to laughter, pointing out that she could hardly wield such an ungainly weapon. Her fury growing, Amiri hefted the weapon and tried to adopt a menacing pose, but the weapon's size threw her off balance and she toppled over, much to the other barbarian's growing amusement.</p>\n<p>It was enough. With a roar, Amiri leapt back to her feet. Her rage filled her body, clouded her vision, stole over her soul. Two of the barbarians had been decapitated by her immense sword before they realized that death had come. The battle was swift and brutal, with Amiri not noticing the blows that landed on her, simply stepping from one traitor to the next and cutting them down.</p>\n<p>When her rage finally subsided, Amiri realized what she had done. She knew that the hunters had certainly deserved their fates, but they were still kin. That her reasons for murdering them were, to her, valid didn't change the ties of blood. She knew that she had cut those ties, and so she turned her back on the remains, trusting that they would be discovered by another hunting party soon enough. As she headed west into the lands of Irrisen and the unknown reaches beyond, her heart was for the first time free—no longer was her future tied to traditions that would constrain her. She has come to value her oversized sword, and even though she can only truly wield it properly when her blood rage takes her, it has become as much a part of her as her fierce independence or her fiery heart. She no longer sees herself as a member of the Six Bears, but never speaks of the circumstances that forced her to flee her homeland. Some things are better left unsaid.</p>","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/deity.svg","value":""},"ethnicity":{"value":"Kellish"},"gender":{"value":"F/She/Her"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"languages":{"details":"","value":["hallit"]},"level":{"value":3},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":1},"arcana":{"rank":0},"athletics":{"rank":0},"crafting":{"rank":0},"deception":{"rank":0},"diplomacy":{"rank":0},"intimidation":{"rank":2},"medicine":{"rank":0},"nature":{"rank":1},"occultism":{"rank":0},"performance":{"rank":0},"religion":{"rank":0},"society":{"rank":0},"stealth":{"rank":0},"survival":{"rank":0},"thievery":{"rank":0}},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.iconics.Actor.aEjJRh8Ru91DfVVN"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"aK7f9lxFTNYTOXJb","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/iconics/QuinnFull.webp","items":[{"_id":"1iXW88VNUJeCM0Gc","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.zVf0Hlp5xG0Q7kmc"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/ancestry/skilled-heritage.webp","name":"Skilled Heritage","sort":0,"system":{"ancestry":{"name":"Human","slug":"human","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.ancestries.Item.IiG7DgeLWYrSNXuX"},"description":{"value":"<p>Your ingenuity allows you to train in a wide variety of skills.

Yet for Quinn himself, trained as a legal clerk and never having personally known the aristocratic comforts his parents mourned, this was no true inconvenience. What frustrated him about his nation was not that power resided with the people, but rather that it was wielded in such a capricious fashion. His fellow citizens' constant false accusations and refusal to abide by court rulings—not to mention the Gray Gardeners' tendency to pronounce sentences completely outside the system—drove young Quinn to distraction.</p>\n<p>When Quinn was 37, having recently lost both parents to an outbreak of plague, his simmering rage finally came to a head. After the ruling faction sentenced a man to death with flagrant disregard for due process, Quinn overstepped his usual role by investigating the matter himself, turning up irrefutable proof of the man's innocence. When his attempts to reopen the case were stymied, he returned the night before the scheduled execution and set the man free—only to run straight into a Gray Gardener patrol. The prisoner escaped in the ensuing fracas, and even as Quinn ran, he heard the Gardeners shouting his name.</p>\n<p>Quinn fled for the Taldan border, knowing that there was now a price on his head. Yet despite all he'd lost, he found himself laughing—for here, in this tragic debacle, he had finally discovered a sense of satisfaction he'd been missing his whole life. He had upheld the law and defended the innocent in spite of government negligence and corruption. By working outside the legal system, he'd helped guide it back toward a righteous path. And he wanted more.</p>\n<p>Thus began a new chapter in Quinn's life. Roaming the nations of the Inner Sea, he constantly keeps an ear out for allegations of unjust accusations or abuses of power. When he finds one, he investigates the case himself, using a lifetime of association with law enforcement agents and detective agencies like The Sleepless to help him ferret out the truth. If the legal system seems fair, he often shows up unexpectedly at the court proceedings, presenting sworn evidence and acting as defending counsel for the accused. If he finds a court to be corrupt, he takes a more direct hand in protecting the innocent. While he respects the law, he also knows that people are imperfect, and that breaking local laws is sometimes necessary in order to uphold more universal ones. Of course, his meddling is rarely popular with the opposition, and so Quinn generally moves along as soon as he's seen justice done and taken steps to ensure that the victim won't suffer further abuses.</p>\n<p>Quinn is a genial, gentlemanly sort, quick with a joke and able to fit easily into both high society and low. His well-honed analytical mind is capable of astounding feats of logic and deduction, and he's fond of sharpening it still further with alchemical extracts learned from his parents and his own personal studies. While formidable in combat, he uses a sword cane so as not to unduly tip off his enemies to his abilities, believing that the best weapon is the one your foe never sees coming.

The more cursebound abilities you use, the more your curse worsens, but you might gain divine benefits even as it tightens its grip on your soul.</p>\n<p>Your oracular curse is expressed using the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.zXZjC8HLaRoLR17U]{Cursebound} condition, a unique condition that affects only oracles. Immediately after the first time you use a cursebound ability, you become cursebound 1, and if you use a cursebound ability while you are already cursebound, you increase the value of your cursebound condition by 1 after the ability resolves. At lower levels, you can tolerate only a modest amount of divine power, and your cursebound condition can't increase beyond cursebound 2; as you grow in levels, you can open yourself to even more power and your cursebound condition can progress to 3 and finally 4. Once saturated in divine power, your soul can't absorb any more, and so you can't use a cursebound ability if you are already at your maximum cursebound condition.</p>\n<p>Your oracular curse lists the specific effects of being cursebound, which are cumulative as your curse progresses. You remain cursebound until you Refocus, which reduces your cursebound condition by 1 in addition to restoring a Focus Point. As your curse is a direct result of divine power, you cannot mitigate, reduce, or remove the effects of your curse or any ability with the cursebound trait by any means other than Refocusing. For example, if a cursebound effect makes creatures @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} from you, you can't negate that concealed condition through a magic item or spell, such as @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Gb7SeieEvd0pL2Eh]{Sure Strike} (though you would still benefit from the other effects of that item or spell).

When he was but an egg, his family left the tengu homeland of Kwanlai, first trekking west to the port city of Goka before boarding a ship to the Inner Sea in search for a better life. Like many immigrants from Tian Xia, they headed for Absalom; however, where they eventually settled was not the City at the Center of the World, but the nearby Isle of Erran.</p>\n<p>Korakai hatched and grew up on those shores, running barefoot on the beaches and rocks. Each day, his mother would dive beneath the waves, holding her breath to collect shellfish, seaweed, and other ingredients that Korakai carried to his family's tavern. There, his father would cook and brew specialties both Tien and Avistani, many a mix of both. The tavern soon became a bustling place for sailors in port, and as Korakai took orders and carried drinks, he'd catch wind of stories from distant lands that he longed to see for himself.</p>\n<p>Every so often, sailors would complain of ill winds or other troubles, and wonder whether the superstitions that tengu could ward off bad luck were true. Whenever they'd ask, Korakai's father would interject, \"Kora, go tell your grandfather someone's here for him.\" The old tengu with the faded feathers was well known among the sailors for his raucous stories and his rituals to dispel misfortune. Though Korakai suspected that much of the time, his grandfather was putting on a show, he knew that whenever the older tengu asked for his \"walking stick\"—a khakkhara, a ringed prayer staff that had been in the family for generations—what followed would be nothing less than a glimpse of old Kwanlai. As his grandfather glided in a whirling dance over the deck of a ship, magical feather fan in one hand and staff in the other, even Korakai's clumsy grasp of the Tengu language could catch words of power amid the chiming of the staff's rings.</p>\n<p>One day, Korakai demanded to go with his grandfather out on the seas. A ferry needed to cross the channel to Kortos for much-needed medicines, despite signs of a storm, and the captain wanted a tengu on board. At first, it seemed like they would evade the worst, but the sea changes in the blink of an eye. A rogue gust pitched the vessel, almost knocking Korakai overboard, and he reached out with his hand for purchase, finding the end of his grandfather's staff. For a moment, he clutched the staff, his grandfather holding the other end—then, the heirloom snapped. Korakai's hand came away with broken metal, and as the khakkhara's rings scattered into the raging sea, Korakai fell with them. The taste of salt assailed his open beak.</p>\n<p>The light from the surface growing distant, Korakai glimpsed a shadow moving through the water toward him: a feathered shape, drinking gourd in one hand. Korakai reached his hand out for help, but the figure was swept away in a twin current of air and water, and Korakai could have sworn he saw a bearded man and a long-haired woman in the spiraling riptide. Again, Korakai tried to swim toward the currents, but again, shadows clashed together—a serpentine creature with a mane of lightning and a pearl-scaled sailfish battled a dragon with salt talons and an invisible force that churned the water into a glaring eye. Blasted back by their conflict, Korakai resigned himself to his fate and sank into the depths.</p>\n<p>He fell for minutes, for hours, for an eternity, the surface a distant memory. Against flashes of lightning that had no right shining this far down, Korakai glimpsed gods, spirits, and more primordial things. Yet he saw that each shape, no matter how powerful, always coalesced from the same elements, and always returned to them once their business was done. In that moment, Korakai understood something, and with a peal of thunder, he broke the surface of the water.</p>\n<p>On deck, Korakai coughed out seawater. The storm had ended, and though the sails were torn, the crew was miraculously unharmed. The sailors cheered for Korakai's grandfather, thinking he had warded off the tempest, but the two tengu knew that it was no jinx-eating superstition to thank, but something deeper; the storm hadn't passed at all, it had come to reside within Korakai. As he released his grip on the now-broken staff, sparks danced between his talons.</p>\n<p>In the years that followed, Korakai learned how to channel and direct—never command—the powers he had discovered in the tempest. As his grandfather grew older, Korakai helped more and more with the elder tengu's duties, and when he passed peacefully in his sleep one spring evening, sailors came from far and wide to witness Korakai return his ashes to the sea, each ship releasing a paper lantern to float across the waves in his memory. Not long thereafter, Korakai decided to leave the island. His parents were supportive; after all, they had crossed half of Golarion once before, why should they object to their son doing the same? Taking up his grandfather's broken staff, Korakai boarded the next ship out, trading the promise of good luck for passage to distant ports.</p>\n<p>Now, Korakai wanders the world with nothing more than the desire to see new sights and collect new experiences, above all hoping to one day visit Kwanlai for himself. Yet even so, he writes home often, sending coin for the tavern when he can, knowing that the beach he grew up on is but an ocean away.</p>","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/deity.svg","value":""},"ethnicity":{"value":""},"gender":{"value":"M/He/Him"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"languages":{"details":"","value":[]},"level":{"value":1},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"focus":{"value":2},"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":0},"arcana":{"rank":0},"athletics":{"rank":1},"crafting":{"rank":1},"deception":{"rank":0},"diplomacy":{"rank":1},"intimidation":{"rank":0},"medicine":{"rank":0},"nature":{"rank":0},"occultism":{"rank":0},"performance":{"rank":0},"religion":{"rank":0},"society":{"rank":0},"stealth":{"rank":0},"survival":{"rank":0},"thievery":{"rank":0}},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.iconics.Actor.BjSkVK5xjK4IxqYT"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"c75yxmpqKG5B4iOz","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/iconics/HarskFull.webp","items":[{"_id":"i49QhtMMGL3swBxM","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/lore.svg","name":"Forest Lore","sort":0,"system":{"description":{"value":""},"mod":{"value":0},"proficient":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"lore","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"qfcIkuw7BXogxxFz","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.UV2sABrTC5teOXTE"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/ancestry/strong-blooded-dwarf.webp","name":"Strong-Blooded Dwarf","sort":0,"system":{"ancestry":{"name":"Dwarf","slug":"dwarf","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.ancestries.Item.BYj5ZvlXZdpaEgA6"},"description":{"value":"<p>Your blood runs hearty and strong, and you can shake off toxins.

As a young dwarf, Harsk spent every spare moment outdoors under the wide skies of southeastern Varisia, particularly at night beneath the stars, where his keen vision made him a hunter without compare. While generally uninterested in his family's traditional smithing, he still inherited enough of their tinkering ability to construct his own crossbow, a heavy, highly accurate weapon that few others are able to wind. Eschewing the company of his fellows, few things made Harsk happier than crouching in a tree stand with his bow, listening to the wind through the forest leaves and waiting for deer or larger prey to wander by.</p>\n<p>That all changed twenty years ago, when his elder brother, a fine captain named Sigur, led a dwarven war band from Janderhoff against a small party of giants that had descended from the Mindspin Mountains to raid and pillage. Out of affection, Sigur offered his less-experienced sibling the chance to come and prove himself as Sigur's chief scout and second-in-command. Calm and peaceful by nature, Harsk turned him down, failing to see the honor his brother was doing him until several days after the company had departed. Traveling light and fast, Harsk caught up with his brother quickly—but not quickly enough. Misjudging the size and skill of the raiding party, Sigur led his band into an ambush, where it was slaughtered to the last dwarf.</p>\n<p>With his brother's blood still fresh on his hands, Harsk went mad with rage. That night, he stalked through the giants' camp like a vengeful wraith, slaughtering giant after giant with his crossbow before melting back into the forest, only to reappear elsewhere and take another victim. When the last giant was left gurgling in the dust, Harsk took up his brother's axe and slipped off into the trees, vowing to forever be the voice of justice in the wild places, to keep balance and prevent the sacrifices of noble men like his brother.</p>\n<p>Harsk, like many of his kind, is gruff and taciturn, but there ends most of his connection to dwarven society. Something of a loner, he prefers to spend his time outdoors, communing with nature, though he occasionally travels alongside others whose goals match his own. Uninterested in the beer and ale that so characterize dwarves in the minds of human society, Harsk instead drinks pot after pot of strong tea to keep his senses sharp. While he never lets his brother's axe out of his sight, he wields it only as a last resort, knowing that his true skills lie in the hunt and striking from darkness.</p>","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/deity.svg","value":""},"ethnicity":{"value":""},"gender":{"value":"M/He/Him"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"dex"},"languages":{"details":"","value":[]},"level":{"value":5},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":1},"arcana":{"rank":0},"athletics":{"rank":2},"crafting":{"rank":1},"deception":{"rank":0},"diplomacy":{"rank":0},"intimidation":{"rank":1},"medicine":{"rank":0},"nature":{"rank":0},"occultism":{"rank":0},"performance":{"rank":0},"religion":{"rank":0},"society":{"rank":0},"stealth":{"rank":1},"survival":{"rank":2},"thievery":{"rank":0}},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.iconics.Actor.c75yxmpqKG5B4iOz"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"cAeHX8Fn8UFdYMz9","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/iconics/LemFull.webp","items":[{"_id":"mYjJumRH5DmPWPzm","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/lore.svg","name":"Theater Lore","sort":0,"system":{"description":{"value":""},"mod":{"value":0},"proficient":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"lore","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"tq344cHokvReSP7T","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.ancestries.Item.GgZAHbrjnzWOZy2v"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/alternatives/ancestries/halfling.svg","name":"Halfling","sort":0,"system":{"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"custom":"","value":["dwarven","elven","gnomish","goblin"]},"boosts":{"0":{"value":["dex"]},"1":{"value":["wis"]},"2":{"selected":"cha","value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"description":{"value":"<p><em>Claiming no place as their own, halflings control few settlements larger than villages.

He had the unfortunate luck to be born into slavery, to a mother indentured to one of Cheliax's countless noble families. Lem was sold a half dozen times to different nobles before he reached the age of two. Such is the fate of most of Cheliax's halflings (often called \"slips\" by that nation's citizens). Halflings are much valued as slaves in Cheliax since they take up less room and since their inborn optimism ironically stunts escape urges. Halflings born into slavery in Cheliax are prone to think of their lot in life as \"lucky.\" They are fond of saying, \"At least we aren't living in the gutter or starving!\"</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, halflings who rankle at the concept of enslavement do appear. Halflings like Lem. Growing up a slave in the devil-haunted empire of Cheliax exposed Lem to a shocking range of decadence and debauchery. He learned from a young age how to say what his superiors wanted to hear, and as he grew older, these skills often secured him less onerous jobs. While his kin toiled in basement washrooms or tended hellhound stables, Lem was taught to play the flute so he could entertain at family gatherings. Yet Lem was not blind to the discomfort of his brothers and sisters, and when he learned that a dozen of his kin were to be sacrificed to a devil as an offering to seal a new trade contract, Lem knew the time to act had come. Taking advantage of his increased mobility in the manor, it was a relatively simple trick to light a few fires in secret corners and then ensure that all of his halfling kin were safe in the slave's quarters. The manor burnt quickly, but Lem was shocked to see his kin rush back to the manor in a hopeless attempt to aid in extinguishing the flames. As the place burnt to the ground, and the halflings bemoaned their fate and the loss of their shelter, Lem slipped away into the night, bitter and distraught over this unexpected turn of events.</p>\n<p>Lem left Cheliax by stowing away on a merchant vessel and never looked back. He rarely speaks of his childhood today, but one can see its effects in his high disdain for law and order, and his intolerance for cruelty. Always quick to side with the underdog, Lem has learned that his most powerful traits are his optimism and sense of humor—virtues that almost make up for his small stature and impulsive nature. Lem's reasons for traveling with his current companions vary upon the day and his mood, but he certainly values their strengths—and the never-ending supply of comedy material their antics provide him.</p>","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/deity.svg","value":""},"ethnicity":{"value":""},"gender":{"value":"M/He/Him"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"languages":{"details":"","value":["diabolic"]},"level":{"value":1},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"focus":{"value":2},"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":1},"arcana":{"rank":0},"athletics":{"rank":0},"crafting":{"rank":0},"deception":{"rank":1},"diplomacy":{"rank":1},"intimidation":{"rank":0},"medicine":{"rank":0},"nature":{"rank":0},"occultism":{"rank":0},"performance":{"rank":0},"religion":{"rank":0},"society":{"rank":1},"stealth":{"rank":1},"survival":{"rank":0},"thievery":{"rank":1}},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.iconics.Actor.cAeHX8Fn8UFdYMz9"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"czQ0MaZBu3BqMpce","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/iconics/MerisielFull.webp","items":[{"_id":"UiFBg6Eav0Dlrzms","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/lore.svg","name":"Underworld Lore","sort":0,"system":{"description":{"value":""},"mod":{"value":0},"proficient":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"lore","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"TzibLgsCWneWhTgQ","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.ancestries.Item.PgKmsA2aKdbLU6O0"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/alternatives/ancestries/elf.svg","name":"Elf","sort":0,"system":{"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"custom":"","value":["draconic","empyrean","fey","gnomish","goblin","kholo","orcish"]},"alternateAncestryBoosts":["dex","cha"],"boosts":{"0":{"value":["dex"]},"1":{"value":["int"]},"2":{"selected":"con","value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"description":{"value":"<p><em>As an ancient people, elves have seen great change and have the perspective that can come only from watching the arc of history.

You choose these spells from the common spells of the tradition determined by your patron or from other spells of that tradition you gain access to.

Feats can also grant your familiar additional spells.</p>\n<p><strong>Learning Spells:</strong> Your familiar can learn new spells independently of your patron. It can learn any spell on your tradition's spell list by physically consuming a written version of that spell over the course of 1 hour. This can be a scroll of that spell, or you can prepare a written version using the Learn a Spell exploration activity. You and your familiar can use the Learn a Spell activity to teach your familiar a spell from another witch's familiar. Both familiars must be present for the entirety of the activity, the spell must be on your spellcasting tradition's spell list, and you must pay the usual cost for that activity, typically in the form of an offering to the other familiar's patron.

Travelers by nature, they spent the short northern summers making slow loops through Hagreach and the Thanelands, facilitating trade. What few memories Feiya has of that life are happy ones: the jostling of wagons, the smell of campfires, and wandering alone through fields and forests, marveling as the wildness closed around her.</p>\n<p>That happiness came to a sudden halt on the fateful day that brought her to the attention of a recently sundered coven of witches who dwelled on the border with Irrisen. Led by a particularly cruel green hag named Nysima, the coven had lost its youngest member to a squad of Blackravens from Trollheim and was still reeling from its sudden loss of power. They witnessed the child as she skipped away from the caravan stop, following a family of deer deep into the woods, and immediately set upon her.</p>\n<p>There's no telling what cruelties the witches would have visited upon the girl had they not suffered their recent loss. As it was, another, no less horrific, fate awaited young Feiya. The two crones seized the child and whisked her away to the east, their mad cackling drowning out the young girl's terrified screams. By the time they reached their snow- and thatch-covered huts, they had given the child a new name and were already envisioning the return of their lost powers.</p>\n<p>The next twelve years were a blur of pain, terror, and misery as Feiya endured the crones' sadistic attempts to teach her their dark craft. Alternating between tutelage and torture, the witches frequently let their cruel natures impede their instruction. For while the young girl showed unmistakable promise and aptitude, she also possessed a defiance that only the harshest of punishments could suppress. On numerous occasions, Feiya tried to escape her imprisonment, only to be tracked down and captured after no more than a few hours. The retributions for these failed attempts have scarred her body and mind in ways that no magic can ever heal.</p>\n<p>One brisk autumn day, after being beaten for failing to properly brew a batch of poisonous blue whinnis, Feiya was sent off to gather herbs. While harvesting more whinnis root, she spied a fox watching her from atop a large rime-covered rock. Unlike the region's typical arctic specimens, this creature had a striking red and orange coloration that stood in stark contrast to the endless snow. There was something about the way the creature watched her that beckoned to Feiya. She approached carefully, and was astonished by his calm and focus. As she neared, the fox trotted a small distance away, turned, and gave her a look that was clearly an invitation to follow. This process was repeated again and again, and before she knew it, Feiya was following the fox on another escape attempt.</p>\n<p>By sundown, the two witches had realized Feiya's intentions. Furious, they set off in pursuit, confident that, as with all previous instances, their hunt would be brief. This time, however, Feiya had guidance. The fox led her along trails never before seen by human nor hag, staying always just ahead and out of reach. When she needed nourishment, the fox led her to game and fresh water. When she needed rest, it stood vigil while she slept. In this manner, Feiya was able to elude capture for more than two weeks.</p>\n<p>One particularly cold evening, however, Feiya's luck ran out. With her pursuers hot on her trail and the fox nowhere to be seen, she found herself trapped in a river valley surrounded on three sides by impassable mountains. Feiya could sense the witches closing in, could hear their promises of pain on the chilling wind. She took shelter in a shallow cave behind the waterfall that fed the river, a curious little grotto whose far wall was emblazoned with a crude carving of a butterfly. Like an animal run to ground, Feiya steeled herself for the coming confrontation. She had come too far this time to surrender without a fight. She determined then and there that her days of living under someone else's yoke were over. She would have her freedom, either in this life or the next.</p>\n<p>It was at that moment that the fox reappeared. Only now, there was something different in the way he approached her. He had always shown a preternatural intelligence, but as Feiya stared into his eyes, she saw a consciousness and a determination that would have frightened her had she not come to trust the animal so implicitly. As she watched him, Feiya was startled by a sudden and overwhelming flurry of sensations invading her mind. She sank, dazed, to the cave floor as the feelings slowly crystallized into coherence. Less a voice than a series of emotions, the promise it offered was unmistakable. Feiya said nothing, but her acceptance was as clear as it was quick.</p>\n<p>What followed will forever haunt Feiya's dreams. Raspy promises of pain and suffering rose above the din of the waterfall as the witches drew near to cave mouth. Feiya could see the outlines of their hunched bodies just beyond the blanket of cascading water, but before she could act, another sound arose. It started as a low rumble, then quickly gained volume, drowning out both hags and water and sending tremors through the cave floor. Then the valley erupted with the screeching and roaring of what could only have been a forest's worth of wild animals, punctured occasionally by the shrill curse of a hag.</p>\n<p>Long minutes passed as Feiya stood, too frightened to move. Then, as gradually as it began, the noise subsided until all that remained was the crash of the waterfall. Feiya crouched down behind a rocky outcropping, afraid to leave the shelter of the cave. As the minutes turned into hours, exhaustion claimed her, and, despite her anxiety, she succumbed to a fitful sleep.</p>\n<p>When dawn finally arrived, Feiya stepped out from the cave, not quite sure what she was expecting to see. A fresh blanket of snow had covered the land, hiding any clues she might have found concerning the events of the previous night. Yet the feeling of relief was palpable. The fox crept up and paused at her side. She was finally free.</p>\n<p>Feiya never discusses the events of that night, nor the particulars of the strange pact she entered into. She may one day try to track down the parents she barely remembers, but for now she is content to roam the world, relishing her freedom, seeking new experiences, and developing her newfound power. Though she desperately desires the company of others, formative years spent away from civilized society have left Feiya lacking in social graces, and her awkwardness often leads to unfortunate misunderstandings. Nevertheless, her inherent good nature tends to win out, and her occasional flares of temper are countered by her steadfast loyalty to her friends. Feiya relishes travel, and having identified the butterfly carving in the waterfall cave as the found-mark of a Desnan priest, she gladly embraces that faith, hoping that her wanderings may cast more light on who she really is—and what entity fosters her magical abilities.</p>","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/deity.svg","value":""},"ethnicity":{"value":"Avistan"},"gender":{"value":"F/She/Her"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"languages":{"details":"","value":["aklo","goblin","jotun","skald","tien"]},"level":{"value":1},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"focus":{"value":2},"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":0},"arcana":{"rank":1},"athletics":{"rank":0},"crafting":{"rank":1},"deception":{"rank":0},"diplomacy":{"rank":0},"intimidation":{"rank":0},"medicine":{"rank":1},"nature":{"rank":1},"occultism":{"rank":0},"performance":{"rank":0},"religion":{"rank":1},"society":{"rank":0},"stealth":{"rank":1},"survival":{"rank":1},"thievery":{"rank":1}},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.iconics.Actor.Eb2G2mRHVd01OKae"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"eOkscZYDaOdfQJr4","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/iconics/FeiyaFull.webp","items":[{"_id":"L1B8q9UQWQw8QTTY","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/lore.svg","name":"Witch Cult Lore","sort":0,"system":{"description":{"value":""},"mod":{"value":0},"proficient":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"lore","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"5qe3KYjbztsu16Gr","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.ancestries.Item.IiG7DgeLWYrSNXuX"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/alternatives/ancestries/human.svg","name":"Human","sort":0,"system":{"additionalLanguages":{"count":1,"custom":"","value":[]},"boosts":{"0":{"selected":"int","value":["cha","con","dex","int","str","wis"]},"1":{"selected":"dex","value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]},"2":{"value":[]}},"description":{"value":"<p><em>As unpredictable and varied as any of Golarion's peoples, humans have exceptional drive and the capacity to endure and expand.

Travelers by nature, they spent the short northern summers making slow loops through Hagreach and the Thanelands, facilitating trade. What few memories Feiya has of that life are happy ones: the jostling of wagons, the smell of campfires, and wandering alone through fields and forests, marveling as the wildness closed around her.</p>\n<p>That happiness came to a sudden halt on the fateful day that brought her to the attention of a recently sundered coven of witches who dwelled on the border with Irrisen. Led by a particularly cruel green hag named Nysima, the coven had lost its youngest member to a squad of Blackravens from Trollheim and was still reeling from its sudden loss of power. They witnessed the child as she skipped away from the caravan stop, following a family of deer deep into the woods, and immediately set upon her.</p>\n<p>There's no telling what cruelties the witches would have visited upon the girl had they not suffered their recent loss. As it was, another, no less horrific, fate awaited young Feiya. The two crones seized the child and whisked her away to the east, their mad cackling drowning out the young girl's terrified screams. By the time they reached their snow- and thatch-covered huts, they had given the child a new name and were already envisioning the return of their lost powers.</p>\n<p>The next twelve years were a blur of pain, terror, and misery as Feiya endured the crones' sadistic attempts to teach her their dark craft. Alternating between tutelage and torture, the witches frequently let their cruel natures impede their instruction. For while the young girl showed unmistakable promise and aptitude, she also possessed a defiance that only the harshest of punishments could suppress. On numerous occasions, Feiya tried to escape her imprisonment, only to be tracked down and captured after no more than a few hours. The retributions for these failed attempts have scarred her body and mind in ways that no magic can ever heal.</p>\n<p>One brisk autumn day, after being beaten for failing to properly brew a batch of poisonous blue whinnis, Feiya was sent off to gather herbs. While harvesting more whinnis root, she spied a fox watching her from atop a large rime-covered rock. Unlike the region's typical arctic specimens, this creature had a striking red and orange coloration that stood in stark contrast to the endless snow. There was something about the way the creature watched her that beckoned to Feiya. She approached carefully, and was astonished by his calm and focus. As she neared, the fox trotted a small distance away, turned, and gave her a look that was clearly an invitation to follow. This process was repeated again and again, and before she knew it, Feiya was following the fox on another escape attempt.</p>\n<p>By sundown, the two witches had realized Feiya's intentions. Furious, they set off in pursuit, confident that, as with all previous instances, their hunt would be brief. This time, however, Feiya had guidance. The fox led her along trails never before seen by human nor hag, staying always just ahead and out of reach. When she needed nourishment, the fox led her to game and fresh water. When she needed rest, it stood vigil while she slept. In this manner, Feiya was able to elude capture for more than two weeks.</p>\n<p>One particularly cold evening, however, Feiya's luck ran out. With her pursuers hot on her trail and the fox nowhere to be seen, she found herself trapped in a river valley surrounded on three sides by impassable mountains. Feiya could sense the witches closing in, could hear their promises of pain on the chilling wind. She took shelter in a shallow cave behind the waterfall that fed the river, a curious little grotto whose far wall was emblazoned with a crude carving of a butterfly. Like an animal run to ground, Feiya steeled herself for the coming confrontation. She had come too far this time to surrender without a fight. She determined then and there that her days of living under someone else's yoke were over. She would have her freedom, either in this life or the next.</p>\n<p>It was at that moment that the fox reappeared. Only now, there was something different in the way he approached her. He had always shown a preternatural intelligence, but as Feiya stared into his eyes, she saw a consciousness and a determination that would have frightened her had she not come to trust the animal so implicitly. As she watched him, Feiya was startled by a sudden and overwhelming flurry of sensations invading her mind. She sank, dazed, to the cave floor as the feelings slowly crystallized into coherence. Less a voice than a series of emotions, the promise it offered was unmistakable. Feiya said nothing, but her acceptance was as clear as it was quick.</p>\n<p>What followed will forever haunt Feiya's dreams. Raspy promises of pain and suffering rose above the din of the waterfall as the witches drew near to cave mouth. Feiya could see the outlines of their hunched bodies just beyond the blanket of cascading water, but before she could act, another sound arose. It started as a low rumble, then quickly gained volume, drowning out both hags and water and sending tremors through the cave floor. Then the valley erupted with the screeching and roaring of what could only have been a forest's worth of wild animals, punctured occasionally by the shrill curse of a hag.</p>\n<p>Long minutes passed as Feiya stood, too frightened to move. Then, as gradually as it began, the noise subsided until all that remained was the crash of the waterfall. Feiya crouched down behind a rocky outcropping, afraid to leave the shelter of the cave. As the minutes turned into hours, exhaustion claimed her, and, despite her anxiety, she succumbed to a fitful sleep.</p>\n<p>When dawn finally arrived, Feiya stepped out from the cave, not quite sure what she was expecting to see. A fresh blanket of snow had covered the land, hiding any clues she might have found concerning the events of the previous night. Yet the feeling of relief was palpable. The fox crept up and paused at her side. She was finally free.</p>\n<p>Feiya never discusses the events of that night, nor the particulars of the strange pact she entered into. She may one day try to track down the parents she barely remembers, but for now she is content to roam the world, relishing her freedom, seeking new experiences, and developing her newfound power. Though she desperately desires the company of others, formative years spent away from civilized society have left Feiya lacking in social graces, and her awkwardness often leads to unfortunate misunderstandings. Nevertheless, her inherent good nature tends to win out, and her occasional flares of temper are countered by her steadfast loyalty to her friends. Feiya relishes travel, and having identified the butterfly carving in the waterfall cave as the found-mark of a Desnan priest, she gladly embraces that faith, hoping that her wanderings may cast more light on who she really is—and what entity fosters her magical abilities.</p>","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/deity.svg","value":""},"ethnicity":{"value":"Avistan"},"gender":{"value":"F/She/Her"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"languages":{"details":"","value":["aklo","goblin","jotun","skald","tien"]},"level":{"value":3},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"focus":{"value":2},"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":0},"arcana":{"rank":1},"athletics":{"rank":0},"crafting":{"rank":1},"deception":{"rank":0},"diplomacy":{"rank":0},"intimidation":{"rank":0},"medicine":{"rank":2},"nature":{"rank":1},"occultism":{"rank":0},"performance":{"rank":0},"religion":{"rank":1},"society":{"rank":0},"stealth":{"rank":1},"survival":{"rank":1},"thievery":{"rank":1}},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.iconics.Actor.eOkscZYDaOdfQJr4"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"ePZefuHdSJ7Jt6KQ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/iconics/SeoniFull.webp","items":[{"_id":"8E9LN7kl4YCjQFfI","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/lore.svg","name":"Hills Lore","sort":0,"system":{"description":{"value":""},"mod":{"value":0},"proficient":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"lore","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"bofgiv1x2pcrw4e4","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.backgrounds.Item.8UXahQfkP9GZ1TNW"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/background.svg","name":"Nomad","sort":0,"system":{"boosts":{"0":{"selected":"wis","value":["con","wis"]},"1":{"selected":"cha","value":["cha","con","dex","int","str","wis"]}},"description":{"value":"<p>Traveling far and wide, you picked up basic tactics for surviving on the road and in unknown lands, getting by with few supplies and even fewer comforts.

At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd level, you gain a new spell from your bloodline and two other 2nd-rank spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might select a higher-rank version of a spell you already know so that you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>\n<p>Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot or vice versa.</p><h3>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</h3><p>As you gain new spells in your spell repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. This spell can be a cantrip, but you can't swap out bloodline spells. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>"},"level":{"value":1},"location":"EGTS5G5H2fPEEreB","prerequisites":{"value":[]},"publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Player Core 2"},"rules":[],"slug":"spell-repertoire-sorcerer","traits":{"rarity":"common","selected":{"sorcerer":"Sorcerer"},"value":["sorcerer"]},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"feat","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"CZAqZnT4bVI4mwI6","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.yBvGqA6Edp6ImaR3"}},"img":"icons/magic/light/projectile-smoke-pink.webp","name":"Sorcerous Potency","sort":100,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"classfeature","description":{"value":"<p>Because of the magical power inherent in your blood, your spells that hurt or cure are stronger than those of other spellcasters.

You are a spellcaster and can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity. The tradition from which your spells come is determined by your bloodline. As a sorcerer, you draw your power from within, and the gestures and incantations you use to shape your power might evoke the nature of your bloodline. For instance, a sorcerer with a demonic bloodline might chant guttural fiendish phrases or make brief curt gestures to cast a spell.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a sorcerer, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast, as shown on the Sorcerer Spells per Day table.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Charisma, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Charisma modifier.</p><h3>Heightening Spells</h3><p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast it in order to heighten it to that rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p><h3>Cantrips</h3><p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of sorcerer spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p><table class=\"pf2e\"><thead><tr><th>Your Level</th><th>Cantrips</th><th>1st</th><th>2nd</th><th>3rd</th><th>4th</th><th>5th</th><th>6th</th><th>7th</th><th>8th</th><th>9th</th><th>10th</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>1*</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>1*</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"12\">* The bloodline paragon class feature gives you a 10th-rank spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</td></tr></tbody></table>"},"level":{"value":1},"location":"EGTS5G5H2fPEEreB","prerequisites":{"value":[]},"publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Player Core 2"},"rules":[],"slug":"sorcerer-spellcasting","traits":{"rarity":"common","selected":{"sorcerer":"Sorcerer"},"value":["sorcerer"]},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"feat","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"vdsjL23qHL5rbvTg","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.H6ziAPvCipTPG8SH"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/bloodline-spells.webp","name":"Bloodline Spells","sort":400,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"classfeature","description":{"value":"<p>Your bloodline grants you bloodline spells, special spells unique to your lineage.

Or at least, she's mostly Varisian—as might be apparent from her otherworldly grace, there's something not quite human in her ancestry.

Coming from a people where tattoo magic maintains a strong following, hers are simultaneously a manifestation of her power and a tool to aid in her castings. The sheer number adorning her skin, as well as the similar patterns woven into her clothes, are a mark of status among her tribe, though many of the so-called \"civilized\" residents of Varisia look upon such body modification with distaste.</p>\n<p>Despite being a consummate adventurer, Seoni is something of an enigma to her compatriots. Quietly neutral on most matters, bound by codes and mandates that she rarely feels compelled to explain, the sorceress keeps her emotions tightly bottled. Extremely detail oriented—what the more pugnacious members of her party call a \"control freak\"—Seoni is a careful and meticulous planner, a schemer who frequently finds herself frustrated by the improvised plans of her more impulsive companions. Despite all of this, Seoni has stuck by her comrades through numerous tight spots, a fact that continues to amaze and confuse Valeros, who wonders loudly (although not altogether unappreciatively) about \"the witch and her schemes.\"</p>\n<p>As with so many things, however, if Seoni understands her motivations, she's keeping that knowledge to herself.</p>","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/deity.svg","value":""},"ethnicity":{"value":""},"gender":{"value":"F/She/Her"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"languages":{"details":"","value":["draconic","vudrani"]},"level":{"value":3},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"focus":{"value":1},"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":0},"arcana":{"rank":1},"athletics":{"rank":0},"crafting":{"rank":1},"deception":{"rank":2},"diplomacy":{"rank":1},"intimidation":{"rank":1},"medicine":{"rank":0},"nature":{"rank":0},"occultism":{"rank":0},"performance":{"rank":0},"religion":{"rank":0},"society":{"rank":0},"stealth":{"rank":0},"survival":{"rank":0},"thievery":{"rank":0}},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.iconics.Actor.ePZefuHdSJ7Jt6KQ"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"eSS9gEzLAY4mqfIk","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/iconics/KyraFull.webp","items":[{"_id":"pX7qEBjjBx3G6Xbn","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/lore.svg","name":"Scribing Lore","sort":1100000,"system":{"description":{"value":""},"mod":{"value":0},"proficient":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"lore","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"Z81ram2Iy3rw3Tfv","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.3lgwjrFEsQVKzhh7"}},"img":"icons/containers/bags/pack-leather-white-tan.webp","name":"Backpack","sort":1800000,"system":{"baseItem":null,"bulk":{"capacity":4,"heldOrStowed":0.1,"ignored":2,"value":0},"collapsed":false,"containerId":null,"description":{"value":"<p>A backpack holds up to 4 Bulk of items and the first 2 Bulk of these items don't count against your Bulk limits.

You can prepare these just like you can any spell on the divine spell list once you can prepare spells of their rank as a cleric. Any of these spells that aren't normally on the divine list are still divine spells if you prepare them this way.</p>\n<h2>Sanctification</h2>\n<p>Depending on your deity, their sanctification can make you holy or unholy. This gives you the holy or unholy trait, which commits you to one side of a struggle over the souls of the planes and may be referenced in other abilities. If you \"can be\" holy or unholy according to your deity, you make that choice, and if you \"must be\" holy or unholy you gain the trait automatically. If you gain the opposing trait in some way, you lose the previous trait until you complete an atone ritual.</p>\n<h2>Anathema</h2>\n<p>Acts fundamentally opposed to your deity's ideals are anathema to your faith. Learning or casting spells, committing acts, and using items that are anathema to your deity remove you from your deity's good graces.</p>\n<p>Casting spells with the unholy trait is almost always anathema to deities who don't allow unholy sanctification, and casting holy spells is likewise anathema to those who don't allow holy sanctification. Similarly, casting spells that are anathema to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your connection to your deity. For example, casting a spell to create undead would be anathema to Pharasma, the goddess of death. Many actions that are anathema don't appear in any deity's formal list.

Known to her faithful as the Dawnflower, the Healing Flame, and the Everlight, she teaches temperance and patience in all things. Compassion and peace are her greatest virtues, and if enemies of the faith can be redeemed, they should be. Yet there are those who have no interest in redemption, who glory in slaughter and death. From the remorseless evil of the undead and fiends to the cruelties born in the hearts of mortals, Sarenrae's doctrines preach swift justice delivered by the scimitar's edge. To this end, she expects her faithful to be skilled at swordplay, both as a form of martial arts promoting centering of mind and body, and so that when they do enter battle, their foes do not suffer any longer than necessary.</p>\n<p>Her priests are often categorized into these two camps—those who favor redemption as a method to defeat the enemy, and those who favor the blade. Kyra is certainly one of the latter. Born in a small farming town to loving parents, Kyra grew up in the shadow of one of the Dawnflower's shrines. She was taken at a young age with the beauty of the shrine's stained glass, and the grace of the three priestesses who practiced swordplay on the nearby hill each dawn as they offered their morning prayers. When bandits attacked her small town, Kyra watched as the priestesses did their best to reason with them—and when that came to naught, to end them before they could do more damage. Unfortunately, the bandits were too strong, and the village burned. Kyra was one of the few survivors, and on the smoking ruins of the shrine she swore her life and sword arm to Sarenrae, swore to protect those who could not protect themselves and to not spare the blade when the time for redemption passes.</p>\n<p>Possessed of a fierce will and pride in her faith and skills with the scimitar, Kyra has traveled far since her trial by fire. She lost her family and home that fateful day, yet where another might be consumed by anger and a thirst for revenge, Kyra has found peace in the Everlight, and in the belief that, if she can prevent even one death at evil hands, her own losses will not have been in vain.</p>","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"class":{"value":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/icons/deity/Sarenrae.webp","value":"Saranrae"},"ethnicity":{"value":"Kelish"},"gender":{"value":"F/She/Her"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"languages":{"details":"","value":["common","kelish"]},"level":{"min":1,"value":3},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"focus":{"value":1},"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"rank":0,"value":0},"reflex":{"rank":0,"value":0},"will":{"rank":0,"value":0}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":0},"arcana":{"rank":0},"athletics":{"rank":1},"crafting":{"rank":0},"deception":{"rank":0},"diplomacy":{"rank":1},"intimidation":{"rank":0},"medicine":{"rank":1},"nature":{"rank":0},"occultism":{"rank":0},"performance":{"rank":1},"religion":{"rank":2},"society":{"rank":0},"stealth":{"rank":0},"survival":{"rank":0},"thievery":{"rank":0}},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.iconics.Actor.eSS9gEzLAY4mqfIk"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"eZs6vj4m99XFUVIV","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/iconics/DajiFull.webp","items":[{"_id":"D8U1Cus37ap3DlEt","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.familiar-abilities.Item.rs4Awf4k1e0Mj797"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Cantrip Connection","sort":0,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"familiar","description":{"value":"<p>You can prepare an additional cantrip, or if you have a repertoire, instead designate a cantrip to add to your repertoire every time you select this ability; you can retrain it but can't otherwise change it.

Yet for Quinn himself, trained as a legal clerk and never having personally known the aristocratic comforts his parents mourned, this was no true inconvenience. What frustrated him about his nation was not that power resided with the people, but rather that it was wielded in such a capricious fashion. His fellow citizens' constant false accusations and refusal to abide by court rulings—not to mention the Gray Gardeners' tendency to pronounce sentences completely outside the system—drove young Quinn to distraction.</p>\n<p>When Quinn was 37, having recently lost both parents to an outbreak of plague, his simmering rage finally came to a head. After the ruling faction sentenced a man to death with flagrant disregard for due process, Quinn overstepped his usual role by investigating the matter himself, turning up irrefutable proof of the man's innocence. When his attempts to reopen the case were stymied, he returned the night before the scheduled execution and set the man free—only to run straight into a Gray Gardener patrol. The prisoner escaped in the ensuing fracas, and even as Quinn ran, he heard the Gardeners shouting his name.</p>\n<p>Quinn fled for the Taldan border, knowing that there was now a price on his head. Yet despite all he'd lost, he found himself laughing—for here, in this tragic debacle, he had finally discovered a sense of satisfaction he'd been missing his whole life. He had upheld the law and defended the innocent in spite of government negligence and corruption. By working outside the legal system, he'd helped guide it back toward a righteous path. And he wanted more.</p>\n<p>Thus began a new chapter in Quinn's life. Roaming the nations of the Inner Sea, he constantly keeps an ear out for allegations of unjust accusations or abuses of power. When he finds one, he investigates the case himself, using a lifetime of association with law enforcement agents and detective agencies like The Sleepless to help him ferret out the truth. If the legal system seems fair, he often shows up unexpectedly at the court proceedings, presenting sworn evidence and acting as defending counsel for the accused. If he finds a court to be corrupt, he takes a more direct hand in protecting the innocent. While he respects the law, he also knows that people are imperfect, and that breaking local laws is sometimes necessary in order to uphold more universal ones. Of course, his meddling is rarely popular with the opposition, and so Quinn generally moves along as soon as he's seen justice done and taken steps to ensure that the victim won't suffer further abuses.</p>\n<p>Quinn is a genial, gentlemanly sort, quick with a joke and able to fit easily into both high society and low. His well-honed analytical mind is capable of astounding feats of logic and deduction, and he's fond of sharpening it still further with alchemical extracts learned from his parents and his own personal studies. While formidable in combat, he uses a sword cane so as not to unduly tip off his enemies to his abilities, believing that the best weapon is the one your foe never sees coming. He's loyal to his friends, and sometimes seems to have a connection in every town, yet is also wary of associating too long or too openly with his allies, knowing that his fight for justice has made him unpopular with various powerful factions.</p>\n<p>Though now well into middle age, Quinn has no intentions of slowing down. As he's fond of telling companions, \"a man needs only three things to change the world: a quick wit, a righteous heart, and a stylish coat.\"</p>","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/deity.svg","value":""},"ethnicity":{"value":""},"gender":{"value":"M/He/Him"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"languages":{"details":"","value":["kelish","mwangi","osiriani","varisian","vudrani"]},"level":{"value":5},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":0},"arcana":{"rank":0},"athletics":{"rank":0},"crafting":{"rank":2},"deception":{"rank":2},"diplomacy":{"rank":2},"intimidation":{"rank":0},"medicine":{"rank":1},"nature":{"rank":1},"occultism":{"rank":1},"performance":{"rank":1},"religion":{"rank":1},"society":{"rank":2},"stealth":{"rank":2},"survival":{"rank":0},"thievery":{"rank":1}},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.iconics.Actor.ezTV9Y2VozwOQphA"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"fA0g6IWg7CR1feg1","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/iconics/MerisielFull.webp","items":[{"_id":"UiFBg6Eav0Dlrzms","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/lore.svg","name":"Underworld Lore","sort":0,"system":{"description":{"value":""},"mod":{"value":0},"proficient":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"lore","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"34Pcj558oR7mGzWe","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.rQWaJhI5Bko5x14Z"}},"img":"icons/weapons/daggers/dagger-straight-blue.webp","name":"Dagger","sort":100000,"system":{"baseItem":"dagger","bonus":{"value":0},"bonusDamage":{"value":0},"bulk":{"value":0.1},"category":"simple","containerId":null,"damage":{"damageType":"piercing","dice":1,"die":"d4"},"description":{"value":"<p>This small, bladed weapon is held in one hand and used to stab a creature in close combat.

In a few rare cases, these foundlings or orphaned elves find loving homes with humans, although the fact that, over the course of their childhood, one-time playmates become their effective guardians and foster parents results in a strangely skewed sense of the self.

A master at stowing away on ships, she's called dozens of cities home, leaving one for another when her companions outgrew her or she outlived them. Life has been hard for Merisiel, made more so by the fact that she's always found it difficult to master skills that come easily to her companions. Never the sharpest knife in the drawer, as the saying goes, Merisiel has learned to make up for this by carrying at least a dozen of them on her person.

You are a spellcaster, and you can cast spells of the arcane tradition using the Cast a Spell activity. As a wizard, when you cast spells, your incantations likely specify exactly what forces you call on and how to shape them, and your gestures precisely shape and direct your magic while circles of arcane runes flare to life.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook (see below), as well as one extra curriculum cantrip and one extra curriculum spell of each rank you can cast from your arcane school. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a wizard, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in the Wizard Spells per Day table.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Intelligence, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Intelligence modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear on page 403.</p>\n<h2>Heightening Spells</h2>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks.</p>\n<h2>Cantrips</h2>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of wizard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level wizard, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level wizard, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p>\n<h2>Spellbook</h2>\n<p>Every arcane spell has a written version, which you record in your personalized book of spells. You start with a spellbook worth 10 sp or less, which you receive for free and must study each day to prepare your spells. Your spellbook's form and name are up to you. It might be a musty, leather-bound tome or an assortment of thin metal disks connected to a brass ring; its name might be esoteric, like <em>The Tome of Silent Shadows</em> or something more academic, like <em>Advanced Pyromantic Applications of Jalmeri Elemental Theory</em>.</p>\n<p>The spellbook contains your choice of 10 arcane cantrips and five 1st-rank arcane spells.

You also add two 1st-rank spells from the curriculum of your arcane school (except in the case of the school of unified magical theory, as described in that school).</p>\n<p>Each time you gain a level, you add two arcane spells to your spellbook, of any spell rank for which you have spell slots, chosen from common spells of your tradition or others you gain access to and learn via Learn a Spell.

In other cases, there's never a choice at all—being raised on the streets leaves few other options available for those who do not wish to become criminals. Rarest are those who come to adventuring late in life.</p>\n<p>This was Ezren's path to adventure. Born to a successful spice merchant in one of Absalom's more affluent districts, Ezren's childhood was pleasantly safe. As the fourth of six siblings, he never knew the responsibility implicit in being the eldest (and therefore the one expected to carry on father's trade) or the freedom of being the youngest. He enjoyed the comforts of a well-to-do family, lived in a neighborhood relatively safe from crime, and seemed poised for a life of mediocrity.</p>\n<p>That changed when his father was taken away, charged with heresy by the church of Abadar. The charges were too spurious to stick, and while his father escaped excommunication, the damage had been done—his father's business fell to pieces. Shocked, dismayed, and convinced that his father was innocent, Ezren abandoned his future and spent his adult life trying to repair his father's ruined reputation. So when Ezren finally uncovered irrefutable proof of his father's guilt, and he realized he'd wasted his life on a lie, he turned his evidence over to the church and said goodbye to his home, his family, and his life.</p>\n<p>At the age of 42, Ezren is full aware that he's missed his adulthood, yet at the same time he looks forward to discovering the world, and making a difference for a cause that he believes in. His dissatisfaction with family, religion, and government left him precious little to trust but his own intellect—in fighting for his father's redemption, he had become a gifted researcher, scholar, and intellectual. Lacking the spry limbs of youth, the trust in religion, the strong arm of the soldier, or the way with words of the politician, Ezren felt he had but one option open. He traveled to tarnished Oppara, capital of Taldor and one of the oldest cities of the continent of Avistan, hoping to join one of several prestigious schools of wizardry. Yet time and time again, he was turned away due to his age. No wizard seemed to want an apprentice who, in many cases, was older than them. So Ezren was forced to strike out on his own once again.</p>\n<p>Over the next decade, as he traveled Avistan, Ezren studied where he could, picking up tricks of the wizard's trade here and there. The combination of arcane study mixed with his worldly first-hand experiences have given him an edge over young wizards fresh out of apprenticeship and eager to make names for themselves. Ezren knows about the many ways the world can trick and betray you, but now he's finally begun to master the art of magic, giving him the tools to fight back.</p>","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/deity.svg","value":""},"ethnicity":{"value":"Varisian"},"gender":{"value":"M/He/Him"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"languages":{"details":"","value":["draconic","dwarven","halfling","sakvroth","varisian"]},"level":{"value":3},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"focus":{"value":1},"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":1},"arcana":{"rank":2},"athletics":{"rank":0},"crafting":{"rank":1},"deception":{"rank":0},"diplomacy":{"rank":0},"intimidation":{"rank":0},"medicine":{"rank":0},"nature":{"rank":1},"occultism":{"rank":1},"performance":{"rank":0},"religion":{"rank":1},"society":{"rank":1},"stealth":{"rank":0},"survival":{"rank":1},"thievery":{"rank":0}},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.iconics.Actor.fY54rsHMzFMHNYFb"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"g1v25LWz7qO705Nx","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/iconics/YoonFull.webp","items":[{"_id":"GLbRpGniarZwqoUM","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.ancestries.Item.IiG7DgeLWYrSNXuX"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/alternatives/ancestries/human.svg","name":"Human","sort":0,"system":{"additionalLanguages":{"count":1,"custom":"","value":[]},"boosts":{"0":{"selected":"dex","value":["cha","con","dex","int","str","wis"]},"1":{"selected":"con","value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]},"2":{"value":[]}},"description":{"value":"<p><em>As unpredictable and varied as any of Golarion's peoples, humans have exceptional drive and the capacity to endure and expand.

Elements you can channel are referred to as your kinetic elements. Your kinetic elements function even in environments where they normally wouldn't. For example, you could use fire actions underwater even though that's normally not possible, and you could create air in a vacuum.</p>\n<p>Your kinetic gate gives you impulse feats, magical actions that let you shape and control your elements in awesome ways. You can select more impulse feats using your kineticist class feats, as described under Impulses. At higher levels, the gate's threshold class feature gives you more impulse feats and lets you choose whether to improve with one element or access new kinetic elements.</p>\n<h3><strong>Single Gate</strong></h3>\n<p>Your kinetic gate links to a single elemental plane, starting you with a single element but giving you greater power with it.

To wield an element, you must have your kinetic aura active and have a free hand, as described in the impulse trait. You automatically gain the Elemental Blast and Base Kinesis impulses, and your kinetic gate selection gives you additional impulse feats. You can select more impulse feats with kineticist class feats, and at higher levels, you'll automatically get more with the gate's threshold class feature. You can select an impulse feat only if it matches one of your kinetic elements.</p>\n<p>Impulses are magical, and though they aren't spells, some things that affect spells also affect impulses. Abilities that restrict you from casting spells (such as being polymorphed into a battle form) or protect against spells (such as a spell that protects against other spells or a creature's bonus to saves against spells) also apply to impulses.</p>\n<h3><strong>Impulse Levels</strong></h3>\n<p>Any impulse you use is the same level you are. For instance, if you're 5th level, your Elemental Blast would be 5th level (and its counteract rank would be 3rd rank), even though you gained the action at 1st level.</p>\n<p>Similar to spells, many impulses get more powerful as you increase in level. In these cases, the impulse ends with one or more \"Level\" entries. This either lists the levels at which the impulse gets an upgrade or has an entry with a plus sign that describes a benefit that increases on a regular basis. For instance, a 1st-level impulse with a \"Level (+4)\" entry would get stronger at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.</p>\n<h3><strong>Impulse Attacks and DCs</strong></h3>\n<p>An impulse that requires a saving throw uses your kineticist class DC. Some of your impulses require you to attempt an <strong>impulse attack roll</strong> to see how effective they are. Your impulse attack roll uses the same proficiency and attribute modifier as your kineticist class DC. Like a spell attack modifier, your impulse attack modifier uses the following formula: d20 roll + attribute modifier + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties. This means your impulse attack roll is typically 10 lower than your class DC. The @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained} condition can reduce your impulse attack rolls and class DCs.

you revere above all others. The most common deities in Pathfinder appear on pages 35–39 of Player Core, along with their edicts, areas of concern, and the benefits you get for being a devotee of that deity. Choose one deity.</p><h2>Skill</h2><p>You become trained in the divine skill listed for your deity. As normal, if you're already trained in that skill, you become trained in a different skill of your choice.</p><h2>Anathema</h2><p>Champions care deeply about the edicts and anathema they take from their deity, sanctification, and cause. As with any implementation of edicts and anathema in the rules, these are a tool for roleplaying between you, the GM, and the other players at the table—you're still playing a nuanced character, not strictly following a script.</p>\n<p>Acts fundamentally opposed to your deity's ideals are anathema to your faith. Learning or casting spells, committing acts, and using items that are anathema to your deity remove you from your deity's good graces.</p>\n<p>Similarly, using items, spells, or actions that are anathema to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your connection to your deity. For example, assisting with a ritual that raises undead would be anathema to Pharasma, the goddess of death. Many actions that are anathema don't appear in any deity's formal list. For borderline cases, you and your GM determine which acts are anathema.</p>\n<p>If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. The class features that you lose are determined by the GM, but they likely include your holy or unholy trait, your focus pool, and your blessing of the devoted. These abilities can be regained only if you repent by conducting an atone ritual. If your deity doesn't require the specific sanctification you had, your GM might let you retrain your sanctification and cause while still following the same deity.</p><h2>Sanctification</h2><p>Depending on your deity, their sanctification can make you holy or unholy. This commits you to one side of a struggle over souls. Whether you become holy, unholy, or neither will limit your choice of causes, devotion spells, and feats.</p>\n<p>If you \"can be\" holy or unholy according to your deity's sanctification entry, you make that choice, and if you \"must be\" holy or unholy, you gain the trait automatically. If the deity lists \"none,\" you can choose only options that don't require the holy or unholy trait. If you are holy or unholy and gain the opposing trait in some way, you lose the previous trait until you atone.</p>\n<p>Unholy sanctification for a champion can be extremely disruptive to a typical game and should be a player character option only in appropriate adventures or campaigns where the group collectively decides to embrace them. Unholy sanctification and causes are uncommon options.</p>\n<p><strong>Holy:</strong> You gain the holy trait and add that trait to any Strikes you make. You gain the edict, \"Do not knowingly harm innocents or fail to prevent harm to an innocent if your direct intervention could save them\" and the anathema \"Commit murder.\" Even if your game includes behavior outside the Pathfinder baseline, the acts listed there are anathema to you.</p>\n<p><strong>Unholy:</strong> You gain the unholy trait and add that trait to any Strikes you make.

Unfortunately, they traded one peril for another, and within months of their settling in Solku, the gnolls of White Canyon began their infamous pillaging. Seelah's parents were slain in the first of these raids, leaving her orphaned at the age of 14 in a strange town. She did what she must to survive on the city streets, pickpocketing and bullying and even hiring herself out as a mercenary. When a group of Iomedae's knights arrived to defend Solku, Seelah was immediately taken with their beautiful, shining armor, and within an hour she had stolen a particularly fine mithral helm with a golden bird upon its brow. Yet then, something strange happened—Seelah became overwhelmed with guilt at her theft. For days, she agonized over the act, trying (and failing) several times to pawn the helm. During the Battle of Red Hail, Seelah realized that one of the bravest knights, a woman named Acemi with hair in long braids, fought the battle without her helm. This was the woman's undoing—in holding Solku's gates, she took a mortal wound to the skull from a gnoll's flail. The woman's heroism carried the day, but that evening she died of her wound.</p>\n<p>Wracked with guilt, Seelah approached Acemi's body as her companions prepared for her pyre. They watched silently as Seelah placed the stolen helm over the dead woman's head, and then climbed onto the pyre aside her to join her in death. The paladins were moved beyond words—they had known from the start that Seelah had stolen the helm, but Acemi had forbidden her brothers and sisters from collecting it, hoping that the helm would bring the desperate orphan enough money to survive for another few months. The knights of Iomedae took Seelah in that night. Although she has come to terms with Acemi's death, Seelah still regrets the theft that ironically brought her into Iomedae's arms. She originally came to Iomedae out of guilt, but in the past several years, that guilt has transformed into a powerful love and faith in the Inheritor.</p>\n<p>The young paladin wears her hair in Acemi's style and is trained in the use of the longsword. In so doing, she hopes to carry on the good work that Acemi might have done had she not fallen at the Battle of Red Hail. It's the least she feels she can do to make up for a death that she allowed to happen.</p>","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"class":{"value":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/icons/deity/Iomedae.webp","value":"Iomedae"},"ethnicity":{"value":""},"gender":{"value":"F/She/Her"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"languages":{"details":"","value":["common","osiriani"]},"level":{"min":1,"value":1},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"focus":{"value":1},"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"rank":0,"value":0},"reflex":{"rank":0,"value":0},"will":{"rank":0,"value":0}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":0},"arcana":{"rank":0},"athletics":{"rank":1},"crafting":{"rank":0},"deception":{"rank":0},"diplomacy":{"rank":1},"intimidation":{"rank":0},"medicine":{"rank":0},"nature":{"rank":0},"occultism":{"rank":0},"performance":{"rank":0},"religion":{"rank":0},"society":{"rank":1},"stealth":{"rank":1},"survival":{"rank":0},"thievery":{"rank":0}},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.iconics.Actor.Gq53oll31r1ZgJzK"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"HLULxhxrF8g96BRk","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/iconics/DroogamiFull.webp","items":[{"_id":"OFJDVugaNu5WIJ5R","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e-animal-companions.AC-Ancestries-and-Class.Item.lOzvLCCy9QRnYw6w"},"pf2e":{"itemGrants":{"animalCompanion":{"id":"djpX15C8CalIm3ug","onDelete":"detach"},"catSupportBenefit":{"id":"sHz8emnDWuuKmPoW","onDelete":"detach"}}}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/ancestry.svg","name":"Cat","sort":0,"system":{"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"custom":"","value":[]},"boosts":{"0":{"value":[]},"1":{"value":[]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"description":{"value":"<p>Your companion is a big cat, such as a leopard or tiger.</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Small</p>\n<p><strong>Melee</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> jaws (finesse), <strong>Damage</strong> 1d6 piercing</p>\n<p><strong>Melee</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> claw (agile, finesse), <strong>Damage</strong> 1d4 slashing</p>\n<p><strong>Str</strong> +2, <strong>Dex</strong> +3, <strong>Con</strong> +1, <strong>Int</strong> -4, <strong>Wis</strong> +2, <strong>Cha</strong> +0</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 4</p>\n<p><strong>Skill</strong> Stealth</p>\n<p><strong>Senses</strong> low-light vision, scent (imprecise, 30 feet)</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 35 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> Your cat deals 1d4 extra precision damage against off-guard targets.</p>\n<p><strong>Support Benefit</strong> Your cat throws your enemies off-balance when you create an opening.

The Chitterwood has been largely left to the goblins since the end of the Goblinblood Wars nearly twenty years ago, its goblin inhabitants now free of the militant influence of their hobgoblin cousins, most of whom were eradicated or driven out of Isger at the closing of the war.</p>\n<p>Fumbus had the honor of serving as apprentice to the Fire-Eater goblin clan's chief pickle-maker, a position which gave him a fair amount of standing amongst his kin. Unfortunately, Fumbus had a particular penchant for experimentation that led to spectacular failures as often as it led to new delicacies. When a particularly unstable batch of \"spicy pickle brine\" exploded in the middle of the Fire-Eater encampment, Fumbus fled the Chitterwood, fearing that the reprisal from his fellow goblins for destroying both the clan's precious pickle barrel and a significant supply of cucumbers would be swift and violent.</p>\n<p>Fumbus's initial forays into the wider world were truly terrifying. Scavenging from human farms usually ended poorly, as vicious dogs and horrifying horses would bite, chase, or stomp the poor goblin if they caught wind of his presence. The humans themselves were often even more terrifying, and Fumbus found himself fleeing pitchfork-wielding mobs with stolen, smelly shoes (easiest to find without a light and useful as either food or clothing) tucked under one arm far more often than he found a safe place to fill his belly and sleep. Fumbus's life likely would have ended at the hands of one of these mobs had he not encountered a passing half-orc Pathfinder named Droven whose initial reaction to the little goblin was humor, rather than fear or violence. Used to dealing with a certain amount of prejudice and distrust himself, Droven dissuaded the mob from pursuing their vendetta against the goblin and allowed Fumbus to accompany him on his mission.</p>\n<p>Droven's heroics entranced young Fumbus, particularly the alchemical fire and other concoctions the half-orc used to defeat his opponents. When Droven completed his mission for the Pathfinder Society, he brought Fumbus back with him to Absalom. Droven helped secure a home for the little goblin in the Puddles district, where Fumbus's presence would be less likely to cause a stir, and shared what he knew of alchemy with the eager goblin. While Fumbus was terrified at the thought of needing to write down formulas, his mind was sharp and he quickly mastered the art of reading; to Fumbus, collecting these foolishly discarded thoughts was no different than surviving off the trash and scraps left on the outskirts of towns and cities. Fumbus came up with his own system for creating and remembering formulas using small tokens engraved with pictographic runes and a series of leather cords, which he would use to bind certain ingredients in specific orders. Together these implements allowed him to practice alchemy without risking his goblin soul or precious thoughts by performing the obscene act of writing anything down. Of further benefit to Fumbus, his new home's location in the Puddles allows the little goblin to experiment with all manner of inflammable and unstable concoctions with little fear of wreaking destruction beyond the building's water-logged rooms.</p>\n<p>Droven offered to sponsor Fumbus into the Pathfinder Society, but the goblin was so impressed by Droven that he truly believed he would not be able to pass the Society's rigorous entry exams. Determined to prove himself, Fumbus busily applied his time and energy to creating new alchemical formulas and perfecting his system for recording his discoveries. As Fumbus's confidence grew, he began to believe that perhaps he might find a place in the Pathfinder Society after all. Skulking through the alleys of Absalom, Fumbus made his way to the Grand Lodge. Upon his arrival, Fumbus learned that Droven had left on a mission several weeks ago and was overdue to report in; his ship was believed lost at sea. Droven had left a letter of sponsorship as well as some funds to secure the goblin a chance to learn at the Society's institutions but Fumbus was unwilling to begin his training without the half-orc present.</p>\n<p>Months have passed and Droven has still not returned. Fumbus spends his time perfecting his alchemy, seeking news of his lost friend, and looking for opportunities to ingratiate himself to the Pathfinder Society, despite multiple assurances from the Society's members and leadership that Fumbus's welcome was already secured by his half-orc friend. Something in Fumbus's mind refuses to let go of the idea that he must prove himself to be a worthy explorer of the same caliber as Droven, whose heroics and skill are unmatched in Fumbus's view. The little goblin has made a decision that he holds sacrosanct: he will earn his entrance to the Society by either finding his friend Droven and bringing the half-orc home, or by performing a truly heroic act worthy of the reputation Droven holds in Fumbus's own eyes.</p>","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/deity.svg","value":""},"ethnicity":{"value":""},"gender":{"value":"M/He/Him"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"languages":{"details":"","value":["draconic","jotun","orcish","osiriani"]},"level":{"value":1},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"crafting":{"infusedReagents":{"value":1}},"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":1},"arcana":{"rank":0},"athletics":{"rank":1},"crafting":{"rank":0},"deception":{"rank":0},"diplomacy":{"rank":1},"intimidation":{"rank":0},"medicine":{"rank":1},"nature":{"rank":0},"occultism":{"rank":0},"performance":{"rank":0},"religion":{"rank":0},"society":{"rank":0},"stealth":{"rank":1},"survival":{"rank":1},"thievery":{"rank":1}},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.iconics.Actor.itzTz6Piij140q6O"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"KC05hgKKrQpg9vOH","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/iconics/MerisielFull.webp","items":[{"_id":"UiFBg6Eav0Dlrzms","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/lore.svg","name":"Underworld Lore","sort":0,"system":{"description":{"value":""},"mod":{"value":0},"proficient":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"lore","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"Itcn6EFapRRni4Go","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.1wVDYY9Wue0G5R9Q"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/ancestry/whisper-elf.webp","name":"Whisper Elf","sort":0,"system":{"ancestry":{"name":"Elf","slug":"elf","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.ancestries.Item.PgKmsA2aKdbLU6O0"},"description":{"value":"<p>Your ears are finely tuned, able to detect even the slightest whispers of sound.

A master at stowing away on ships, she's called dozens of cities home, leaving one for another when her companions outgrew her or she outlived them. Life has been hard for Merisiel, made more so by the fact that she's always found it difficult to master skills that come easily to her companions. Never the sharpest knife in the drawer, as the saying goes, Merisiel has learned to make up for this by carrying at least a dozen of them on her person. When things go wrong with her carefully laid plans (as they almost always seem to do), the knives come out and what needs to be done gets done. To date, Merisiel hasn't met a problem that can't, in one way or another, be solved with daggers.</p>\n<p>Merisiel's life experiences have taught her to enjoy things to their fullest as they occur—it's impossible to tell when the good times might end. She's open and expressive with her thoughts and emotions, and while she's always on the move and working on her latest batch of plots for easy money, in the end it comes down to being faster than everyone else—either on her feet, or with her beloved blades.</p>\n<p>She wouldn't have it any other way.</p>","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/deity.svg","value":""},"ethnicity":{"value":""},"gender":{"value":"F/She/Her"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"dex"},"languages":{"details":"","value":[]},"level":{"value":5},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":2},"arcana":{"rank":0},"athletics":{"rank":1},"crafting":{"rank":1},"deception":{"rank":2},"diplomacy":{"rank":0},"intimidation":{"rank":1},"medicine":{"rank":1},"nature":{"rank":0},"occultism":{"rank":0},"performance":{"rank":0},"religion":{"rank":0},"society":{"rank":1},"stealth":{"rank":2},"survival":{"rank":1},"thievery":{"rank":2}},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.iconics.Actor.KC05hgKKrQpg9vOH"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"KQXXdJeD8nbMSqgZ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/iconics/SeoniFull.webp","items":[{"_id":"8E9LN7kl4YCjQFfI","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/lore.svg","name":"Hills Lore","sort":0,"system":{"description":{"value":""},"mod":{"value":0},"proficient":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"lore","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"bofgiv1x2pcrw4e4","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.backgrounds.Item.8UXahQfkP9GZ1TNW"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/background.svg","name":"Nomad","sort":0,"system":{"boosts":{"0":{"selected":"wis","value":["con","wis"]},"1":{"selected":"cha","value":["cha","con","dex","int","str","wis"]}},"description":{"value":"<p>Traveling far and wide, you picked up basic tactics for surviving on the road and in unknown lands, getting by with few supplies and even fewer comforts.

At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd level, you gain a new spell from your bloodline and two other 2nd-rank spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might select a higher-rank version of a spell you already know so that you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>\n<p>Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot or vice versa.</p><h3>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</h3><p>As you gain new spells in your spell repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. This spell can be a cantrip, but you can't swap out bloodline spells. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>"},"level":{"value":1},"location":"78NVv3PGCR5rIN55","prerequisites":{"value":[]},"publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Player Core 2"},"rules":[],"slug":"spell-repertoire-sorcerer","traits":{"rarity":"common","selected":{"sorcerer":"Sorcerer"},"value":["sorcerer"]},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"feat","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"bEIU8Gwjz80xkaXV","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.gmnx7e1g08bppbqt"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/signature-spells-sorcerer.webp","name":"Sorcerer Spellcasting","sort":200,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"classfeature","description":{"value":"<h2>Sorcerer Spellcasting</h2><p>Your bloodline provides you with incredible magical power. You are a spellcaster and can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity. The tradition from which your spells come is determined by your bloodline. As a sorcerer, you draw your power from within, and the gestures and incantations you use to shape your power might evoke the nature of your bloodline. For instance, a sorcerer with a demonic bloodline might chant guttural fiendish phrases or make brief curt gestures to cast a spell.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a sorcerer, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast, as shown on the Sorcerer Spells per Day table.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Charisma, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Charisma modifier.</p><h3>Heightening Spells</h3><p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast it in order to heighten it to that rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p><h3>Cantrips</h3><p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of sorcerer spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p><table class=\"pf2e\"><thead><tr><th>Your Level</th><th>Cantrips</th><th>1st</th><th>2nd</th><th>3rd</th><th>4th</th><th>5th</th><th>6th</th><th>7th</th><th>8th</th><th>9th</th><th>10th</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>1*</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>1*</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"12\">* The bloodline paragon class feature gives you a 10th-rank spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</td></tr></tbody></table>"},"level":{"value":1},"location":"78NVv3PGCR5rIN55","prerequisites":{"value":[]},"publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Player Core 2"},"rules":[],"slug":"sorcerer-spellcasting","traits":{"rarity":"common","selected":{"sorcerer":"Sorcerer"},"value":["sorcerer"]},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"feat","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"2RGTLXu0aocgkkzK","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.2goYo6VNbwC6aKF1"},"pf2e":{"itemGrants":{"bloodlineImperial":{"id":"yTHpCdZkwGxzVIuj","onDelete":"detach"}}}},"img":"icons/magic/symbols/question-stone-yellow.webp","name":"Bloodline","sort":300,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"classfeature","description":{"value":"<p>Choose a bloodline that gives you your spellcasting talent.

At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd level, you select two 2nd-rank spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-rank version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>\n<p>Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<h2>Swapping Spells In Your Repertoire</h2>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>"},"level":{"value":1},"location":"MphUFQreUzlZ45IR","prerequisites":{"value":[]},"publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Player Core"},"rules":[],"slug":"spell-repertoire-bard","traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["bard"]},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"feat","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"sG2jMrmI0QDcyUrF","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.sVjATEo8eqkAosNp"},"pf2e":{"grantedBy":{"id":"gY9mqcIWHnKqKmtu","onDelete":"cascade"}}},"img":"icons/sundries/books/book-red-exclamation.webp","name":"Lingering Composition","sort":0,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"class","description":{"value":"<p>By adding a flourish, you make your compositions last longer.

He had the unfortunate luck to be born into slavery, to a mother indentured to one of Cheliax's countless noble families. Lem was sold a half dozen times to different nobles before he reached the age of two. Such is the fate of most of Cheliax's halflings (often called \"slips\" by that nation's citizens). Halflings are much valued as slaves in Cheliax since they take up less room and since their inborn optimism ironically stunts escape urges. Halflings born into slavery in Cheliax are prone to think of their lot in life as \"lucky.\" They are fond of saying, \"At least we aren't living in the gutter or starving!\"</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, halflings who rankle at the concept of enslavement do appear. Halflings like Lem. Growing up a slave in the devil-haunted empire of Cheliax exposed Lem to a shocking range of decadence and debauchery. He learned from a young age how to say what his superiors wanted to hear, and as he grew older, these skills often secured him less onerous jobs. While his kin toiled in basement washrooms or tended hellhound stables, Lem was taught to play the flute so he could entertain at family gatherings. Yet Lem was not blind to the discomfort of his brothers and sisters, and when he learned that a dozen of his kin were to be sacrificed to a devil as an offering to seal a new trade contract, Lem knew the time to act had come. Taking advantage of his increased mobility in the manor, it was a relatively simple trick to light a few fires in secret corners and then ensure that all of his halfling kin were safe in the slave's quarters. The manor burnt quickly, but Lem was shocked to see his kin rush back to the manor in a hopeless attempt to aid in extinguishing the flames. As the place burnt to the ground, and the halflings bemoaned their fate and the loss of their shelter, Lem slipped away into the night, bitter and distraught over this unexpected turn of events.</p>\n<p>Lem left Cheliax by stowing away on a merchant vessel and never looked back. He rarely speaks of his childhood today, but one can see its effects in his high disdain for law and order, and his intolerance for cruelty. Always quick to side with the underdog, Lem has learned that his most powerful traits are his optimism and sense of humor—virtues that almost make up for his small stature and impulsive nature.

Strict padaprajna discipline forged a tight bond between the twins, who spent even their infrequent times of rest together, practicing the latest martial techniques taught to them. On their twelfth birthday, the twins were forcefully separated: Sajan went to live with the fighting men of the ghana padaprajna, while Sajni joined the battling women of the sastra padaprajna. Despite their separation, the twins continued to meet when they could, sparring and joking as they had in their childhoods.</p>\n<p>As the insightful narrative of the <em>Vigrahin Patitraka</em> states, \"A warrior's life is to war.\" Thus it was that Sajan's lord embroiled himself in a conflict with a neighbor. Most of the army fielded by Sajan's lord consisted of conscripts wielding tools of their trades, while the valuable padaprajna watched the battle in reserve. The warriors deduced quickly that they stood on the losing side, but they were duty-bound to fight to the death when instructed. Instead, their lord stole from them the glory of battle-death when he sued for peace after his conscripts fled the field. As part of his surrender, the lord gave over half of his sastra padapranja—including young Sajni.</p>\n<p>Distraught, Sajan returned to his barracks in tears (for which he received severe beatings from his own father), and vowed that night to be reunited with his sister. Several weeks passed before he found his opportunity for escape. He fled into the countryside and slipped stealthily into the city of Sumadhadra, through whose gates Sajan watched his sister pass. After several days of clumsily seeking information on his sister, he finally discovered that all the traded sastra padapranja were loaded onto ships bound for distant Jalmeray.</p>\n<p>Sajan quickly hired himself as a guard aboard a ship bound for the far-away island, and several months later he found himself on its heavily guarded docks. Within a week, Sajan uncovered the fates of most of the sastra padapranja, who worked as guards and courtiers for the island's thakur. Sajni was not among them. More weeks passed before Sajan learned that his sister had, like him, signed on as a guard aboard a trading ship—hers bound for a place called Absalom.</p>\n<p>The desperate young padapranja gained passage to Absalom and, upon arrival, stared in wonder at its size and splendor. It seemed to him that the strange western barbarians he found himself among were incapable of a place so grand. By the time he found his bearings and rejoined his search, however, he found himself without leads, for the sheer size that so impressed him also made finding his sister nearly impossible.</p>\n<p>Sajan knows he cannot return to Vudra, for the padapranja there would execute him as a deserter. He cares not for his home country, however, and continues to seek out any clue that might point him toward his sister.</p>","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/deity.svg","value":""},"ethnicity":{"value":""},"gender":{"value":"M/He/Him"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"dex"},"languages":{"details":"","value":["vudrani"]},"level":{"value":1},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"focus":{"value":1},"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":0},"arcana":{"rank":0},"athletics":{"rank":1},"crafting":{"rank":0},"deception":{"rank":0},"diplomacy":{"rank":1},"intimidation":{"rank":0},"medicine":{"rank":0},"nature":{"rank":0},"occultism":{"rank":0},"performance":{"rank":0},"religion":{"rank":1},"society":{"rank":0},"stealth":{"rank":1},"survival":{"rank":0},"thievery":{"rank":0}},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.iconics.Actor.mLR3MACZOnapZzZp"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"MN9BqArrzWL3u0AT","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/iconics/JirelleFull.webp","items":[{"_id":"54TF5PQy0vpGust7","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.N36ZR4lh9eCazDaN"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/ancestry/half-elf.webp","name":"Half-Elf","sort":0,"system":{"ancestry":{"name":"Human","slug":"human","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.ancestries.Item.IiG7DgeLWYrSNXuX"},"description":{"value":"<p>Either one of your parents was an elf, or one or both were half-elves.

She makes new friends as swiftly as she strikes with her rapier, and while she has a flair for the dramatic (why merely attack a foe when you can make a show of it with a twirl of the cape or a somersault or two?), she never favors ostentation or glory over the opportunity to help a friend in need. Jirelle understands that the strength of one's relationships with friends, allies, lovers, and family make one strong. It was her mother's failure to forge such bonds that allowed a young Jirelle to escape from a life that would have likely seen offered as sacrifice to the shark demon Ovonovo before the close of her thirteenth birthday.</p>\n<p>On the subject of her mother or her ship, the <em>Bloodcrow</em>, the typically light-hearted half-elf grows serious. Jirelle does not share the secrets of her childhood with just anyone. As such, few know how she engineered the sinking of the <em>Bloodcrow</em> and the death of her wretched elven mother off the coast of Tempest Cay. Jirelle often jokes that she befriends for life, with the playful, only slightly malicious glint in her eyes implying what might happen to those who would betray such friendship.</p>\n<p>After escaping the <em>Bloodcrow</em>, Jirelle spent some time surviving as a street rat in the alleys of Drenchport. Armed with a fine rapier and clad in her her mother's magical cloak (the only two things she managed to escape the <em>Bloodcrow</em>'s wreckage with), Jirelle kept every coin and bauble she earned in a thrice-locked chest she keeps well hidden and protected. At first, she'd hoped to save enough money to afford a move from the Shackles to distant Taldor, drawn by tales of a land where duels and extravagance and civility promised a better life. But when rumors of a strange, ghostly ship plying the sea-ways of the Shackles reached her-fearful stories of a vessel commanded by an imperious banshee and bound by undeath-Jirelle realized that in sinking the <em>Bloodcrow</em> she'd done the exact opposite of what she'd intended. Rather than spare the Shackles of a brutal pirate queen, she'd unleashed an even deadlier scourge upon the Fever Sea.</p>\n<p>Today, Jirelle seeks the funds to someday finance a ship and crew of her own. She plans not to become a pirate-for a life of plunder and cruelty holds no appeal for the daring swashbuckler-but to finish the job she started on the eve of her thirteenth birthday. Jirelle knows she can't do this on her own, though. So she seeks true and able allies, knowing that only with bravery and trust will the <em>Bloodcrow</em>'s days be numbered.</p>","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/deity.svg","value":""},"ethnicity":{"value":""},"gender":{"value":"F/She/Her"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"languages":{"details":"","value":["mwangi"]},"level":{"value":3},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":2},"arcana":{"rank":0},"athletics":{"rank":0},"crafting":{"rank":0},"deception":{"rank":2},"diplomacy":{"rank":1},"intimidation":{"rank":0},"medicine":{"rank":0},"nature":{"rank":0},"occultism":{"rank":0},"performance":{"rank":0},"religion":{"rank":0},"society":{"rank":1},"stealth":{"rank":1},"survival":{"rank":0},"thievery":{"rank":1}},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.iconics.Actor.MN9BqArrzWL3u0AT"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"OlR1ZpTMxfZd0nq5","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/iconics/LiniFull.webp","items":[{"_id":"NimM8csExNjhJz7E","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/lore.svg","name":"Herbalism Lore","sort":0,"system":{"description":{"value":""},"mod":{"value":0},"proficient":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"lore","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"H8J6HH7OzFDqCuWm","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.ancestries.Item.CYlfsYLJcBOgqKtD"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/alternatives/ancestries/gnome.svg","name":"Gnome","sort":0,"system":{"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"custom":"","value":["draconic","dwarven","elven","goblin","jotun","orcish"]},"boosts":{"0":{"value":["cha"]},"1":{"value":["con"]},"2":{"selected":"wis","value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"description":{"value":"<p><em>Long ago, early gnome ancestors emigrated from the First World, realm of the fey.

More than once, Lini's traveling companions or enclave came under threat from some great bear or razor-clawed cat, but with a series of soothing noises and precise motions Lini always tamed the beast and sent it on its way.</p>\n<p>Lini's success at calming animals came to an end one day when a snow leopard bound out of the trees and pinned her to the ground before she could react. Her friends scattered, leaving Lini alone to face the beast. Although fascinated by the cat's power and speed, and appreciative of the animal's beauty, Lini trembled under her massive paw and tears leaked from her eyes. She knew she faced her doom, and she found it cruelly ironic how death came to claim her.</p>\n<p>Yet the leopard did not strike.</p>\n<p>\"Your friends have abandoned you,\" a calm feminine voice intoned out of Lini's sight. \"Despite the times you saved them, they left you to die.\" Although Lini could not see the woman, Lini knew of the Norn of the forest and suspected she was one of them.</p>\n<p>\"Please help me,\" Lini whispered, her chest struggling to rise under the great cat's crushing paw.</p>\n<p>\"You do not need my help, little one. You need hers.\"</p>\n<p>Lini looked at the snow leopard, deep into her eyes. She saw neither hunger or malice. Still struggling just to breathe, Lini stared into the great cat's eyes and asked, \"Will you help me?\"</p>\n<p>Inexplicably, the snow leopard lifted her paw from Lini's chest. A coughing fit then overcame the small gnome, and when she finally recovered she looked around her. The snow leopard was gone and Lini saw no sign of the Norn. She looked around frantically, suddenly alone and scared. A small gnome in a large world.</p>\n<p>\"Come back,\" Lini cried. \"Don't go! Please don't go. Don't leave me alone.\" She sank to her knees, tears afresh on her face, until she heard the sound of approaching footsteps.</p>\n<p>The snow leopard had returned. With the delicateness of a mother tending to her cubs, the great cat licked gently at Lini's face, whisking away her tears. Lini threw her arms around the leopard's neck. \"You are my friend, aren't you? I will call you Droogami.

He had the unfortunate luck to be born into slavery, to a mother indentured to one of Cheliax's countless noble families. Lem was sold a half dozen times to different nobles before he reached the age of two. Such is the fate of most of Cheliax's halflings (often called \"slips\" by that nation's citizens). Halflings are much valued as slaves in Cheliax since they take up less room and since their inborn optimism ironically stunts escape urges. Halflings born into slavery in Cheliax are prone to think of their lot in life as \"lucky.\" They are fond of saying, \"At least we aren't living in the gutter or starving!\"</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, halflings who rankle at the concept of enslavement do appear. Halflings like Lem. Growing up a slave in the devil-haunted empire of Cheliax exposed Lem to a shocking range of decadence and debauchery. He learned from a young age how to say what his superiors wanted to hear, and as he grew older, these skills often secured him less onerous jobs. While his kin toiled in basement washrooms or tended hellhound stables, Lem was taught to play the flute so he could entertain at family gatherings. Yet Lem was not blind to the discomfort of his brothers and sisters, and when he learned that a dozen of his kin were to be sacrificed to a devil as an offering to seal a new trade contract, Lem knew the time to act had come. Taking advantage of his increased mobility in the manor, it was a relatively simple trick to light a few fires in secret corners and then ensure that all of his halfling kin were safe in the slave's quarters. The manor burnt quickly, but Lem was shocked to see his kin rush back to the manor in a hopeless attempt to aid in extinguishing the flames. As the place burnt to the ground, and the halflings bemoaned their fate and the loss of their shelter, Lem slipped away into the night, bitter and distraught over this unexpected turn of events.</p>\n<p>Lem left Cheliax by stowing away on a merchant vessel and never looked back. He rarely speaks of his childhood today, but one can see its effects in his high disdain for law and order, and his intolerance for cruelty. Always quick to side with the underdog, Lem has learned that his most powerful traits are his optimism and sense of humor—virtues that almost make up for his small stature and impulsive nature.

Strict padaprajna discipline forged a tight bond between the twins, who spent even their infrequent times of rest together, practicing the latest martial techniques taught to them. On their twelfth birthday, the twins were forcefully separated: Sajan went to live with the fighting men of the ghana padaprajna, while Sajni joined the battling women of the sastra padaprajna. Despite their separation, the twins continued to meet when they could, sparring and joking as they had in their childhoods.</p>\n<p>As the insightful narrative of the <em>Vigrahin Patitraka</em> states, \"A warrior's life is to war.\" Thus it was that Sajan's lord embroiled himself in a conflict with a neighbor. Most of the army fielded by Sajan's lord consisted of conscripts wielding tools of their trades, while the valuable padaprajna watched the battle in reserve. The warriors deduced quickly that they stood on the losing side, but they were duty-bound to fight to the death when instructed. Instead, their lord stole from them the glory of battle-death when he sued for peace after his conscripts fled the field. As part of his surrender, the lord gave over half of his sastra padapranja—including young Sajni.</p>\n<p>Distraught, Sajan returned to his barracks in tears (for which he received severe beatings from his own father), and vowed that night to be reunited with his sister. Several weeks passed before he found his opportunity for escape. He fled into the countryside and slipped stealthily into the city of Sumadhadra, through whose gates Sajan watched his sister pass. After several days of clumsily seeking information on his sister, he finally discovered that all the traded sastra padapranja were loaded onto ships bound for distant Jalmeray.</p>\n<p>Sajan quickly hired himself as a guard aboard a ship bound for the far-away island, and several months later he found himself on its heavily guarded docks. Within a week, Sajan uncovered the fates of most of the sastra padapranja, who worked as guards and courtiers for the island's thakur. Sajni was not among them. More weeks passed before Sajan learned that his sister had, like him, signed on as a guard aboard a trading ship—hers bound for a place called Absalom.</p>\n<p>The desperate young padapranja gained passage to Absalom and, upon arrival, stared in wonder at its size and splendor. It seemed to him that the strange western barbarians he found himself among were incapable of a place so grand. By the time he found his bearings and rejoined his search, however, he found himself without leads, for the sheer size that so impressed him also made finding his sister nearly impossible.</p>\n<p>Sajan knows he cannot return to Vudra, for the padapranja there would execute him as a deserter. He cares not for his home country, however, and continues to seek out any clue that might point him toward his sister.</p>","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/deity.svg","value":""},"ethnicity":{"value":""},"gender":{"value":"M/He/Him"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"dex"},"languages":{"details":"","value":["vudrani"]},"level":{"value":3},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"proficiencies":{"attacks":{"martial":{"rank":1}}},"resources":{"focus":{"value":1},"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":1},"arcana":{"rank":0},"athletics":{"rank":2},"crafting":{"rank":0},"deception":{"rank":0},"diplomacy":{"rank":1},"intimidation":{"rank":0},"medicine":{"rank":0},"nature":{"rank":0},"occultism":{"rank":0},"performance":{"rank":0},"religion":{"rank":1},"society":{"rank":0},"stealth":{"rank":1},"survival":{"rank":0},"thievery":{"rank":0}},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.iconics.Actor.PEoGutSKfLrRpLfY"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"Pgwirgn9Jm9SSIAB","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/iconics/SeoniFull.webp","items":[{"_id":"8E9LN7kl4YCjQFfI","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/lore.svg","name":"Hills Lore","sort":0,"system":{"description":{"value":""},"mod":{"value":0},"proficient":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"lore","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"bofgiv1x2pcrw4e4","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.backgrounds.Item.8UXahQfkP9GZ1TNW"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/background.svg","name":"Nomad","sort":0,"system":{"boosts":{"0":{"selected":"wis","value":["con","wis"]},"1":{"selected":"cha","value":["cha","con","dex","int","str","wis"]}},"description":{"value":"<p>Traveling far and wide, you picked up basic tactics for surviving on the road and in unknown lands, getting by with few supplies and even fewer comforts.

You are a spellcaster and can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity. The tradition from which your spells come is determined by your bloodline. As a sorcerer, you draw your power from within, and the gestures and incantations you use to shape your power might evoke the nature of your bloodline. For instance, a sorcerer with a demonic bloodline might chant guttural fiendish phrases or make brief curt gestures to cast a spell.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a sorcerer, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast, as shown on the Sorcerer Spells per Day table.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Charisma, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Charisma modifier.</p><h3>Heightening Spells</h3><p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast it in order to heighten it to that rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p><h3>Cantrips</h3><p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of sorcerer spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p><table class=\"pf2e\"><thead><tr><th>Your Level</th><th>Cantrips</th><th>1st</th><th>2nd</th><th>3rd</th><th>4th</th><th>5th</th><th>6th</th><th>7th</th><th>8th</th><th>9th</th><th>10th</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>1*</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>1*</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"12\">* The bloodline paragon class feature gives you a 10th-rank spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</td></tr></tbody></table>"},"level":{"value":1},"location":"EGTS5G5H2fPEEreB","prerequisites":{"value":[]},"publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Player Core 2"},"rules":[],"slug":"sorcerer-spellcasting","traits":{"rarity":"common","selected":{"sorcerer":"Sorcerer"},"value":["sorcerer"]},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"feat","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"vdsjL23qHL5rbvTg","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.H6ziAPvCipTPG8SH"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/bloodline-spells.webp","name":"Bloodline Spells","sort":400,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"classfeature","description":{"value":"<p>Your bloodline grants you bloodline spells, special spells unique to your lineage.

Quietly neutral on most matters, bound by codes and mandates that she rarely feels compelled to explain, the sorceress keeps her emotions tightly bottled. Extremely detail oriented—what the more pugnacious members of her party call a \"control freak\"—Seoni is a careful and meticulous planner, a schemer who frequently finds herself frustrated by the improvised plans of her more impulsive companions. Despite all of this, Seoni has stuck by her comrades through numerous tight spots, a fact that continues to amaze and confuse Valeros, who wonders loudly (although not altogether unappreciatively) about \"the witch and her schemes.\"</p>\n<p>As with so many things, however, if Seoni understands her motivations, she's keeping that knowledge to herself.</p>","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/deity.svg","value":""},"ethnicity":{"value":""},"gender":{"value":"F/She/Her"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"languages":{"details":"","value":["draconic","vudrani"]},"level":{"value":5},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"focus":{"value":1},"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":0},"arcana":{"rank":2},"athletics":{"rank":0},"crafting":{"rank":1},"deception":{"rank":2},"diplomacy":{"rank":1},"intimidation":{"rank":1},"medicine":{"rank":0},"nature":{"rank":0},"occultism":{"rank":0},"performance":{"rank":0},"religion":{"rank":0},"society":{"rank":0},"stealth":{"rank":0},"survival":{"rank":0},"thievery":{"rank":0}},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.iconics.Actor.Pgwirgn9Jm9SSIAB"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"psZZ5FZfDJv5MM51","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/iconics/JirelleFull.webp","items":[{"_id":"54TF5PQy0vpGust7","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.N36ZR4lh9eCazDaN"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/ancestry/half-elf.webp","name":"Half-Elf","sort":0,"system":{"ancestry":{"name":"Human","slug":"human","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.ancestries.Item.IiG7DgeLWYrSNXuX"},"description":{"value":"<p>Either one of your parents was an elf, or one or both were half-elves.

She makes new friends as swiftly as she strikes with her rapier, and while she has a flair for the dramatic (why merely attack a foe when you can make a show of it with a twirl of the cape or a somersault or two?), she never favors ostentation or glory over the opportunity to help a friend in need. Jirelle understands that the strength of one's relationships with friends, allies, lovers, and family make one strong. It was her mother's failure to forge such bonds that allowed a young Jirelle to escape from a life that would have likely seen offered as sacrifice to the shark demon Ovonovo before the close of her thirteenth birthday.</p>\n<p>On the subject of her mother or her ship, the <em>Bloodcrow</em>, the typically light-hearted half-elf grows serious. Jirelle does not share the secrets of her childhood with just anyone. As such, few know how she engineered the sinking of the <em>Bloodcrow</em> and the death of her wretched elven mother off the coast of Tempest Cay. Jirelle often jokes that she befriends for life, with the playful, only slightly malicious glint in her eyes implying what might happen to those who would betray such friendship.</p>\n<p>After escaping the <em>Bloodcrow</em>, Jirelle spent some time surviving as a street rat in the alleys of Drenchport. Armed with a fine rapier and clad in her her mother's magical cloak (the only two things she managed to escape the <em>Bloodcrow</em>'s wreckage with), Jirelle kept every coin and bauble she earned in a thrice-locked chest she keeps well hidden and protected. At first, she'd hoped to save enough money to afford a move from the Shackles to distant Taldor, drawn by tales of a land where duels and extravagance and civility promised a better life. But when rumors of a strange, ghostly ship plying the sea-ways of the Shackles reached her-fearful stories of a vessel commanded by an imperious banshee and bound by undeath-Jirelle realized that in sinking the <em>Bloodcrow</em> she'd done the exact opposite of what she'd intended. Rather than spare the Shackles of a brutal pirate queen, she'd unleashed an even deadlier scourge upon the Fever Sea.</p>\n<p>Today, Jirelle seeks the funds to someday finance a ship and crew of her own. She plans not to become a pirate-for a life of plunder and cruelty holds no appeal for the daring swashbuckler-but to finish the job she started on the eve of her thirteenth birthday. Jirelle knows she can't do this on her own, though. So she seeks true and able allies, knowing that only with bravery and trust will the <em>Bloodcrow</em>'s days be numbered.</p>","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/deity.svg","value":""},"ethnicity":{"value":""},"gender":{"value":"F/She/Her"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"languages":{"details":"","value":["mwangi"]},"level":{"value":5},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":2},"arcana":{"rank":0},"athletics":{"rank":0},"crafting":{"rank":0},"deception":{"rank":2},"diplomacy":{"rank":2},"intimidation":{"rank":0},"medicine":{"rank":0},"nature":{"rank":0},"occultism":{"rank":0},"performance":{"rank":0},"religion":{"rank":0},"society":{"rank":1},"stealth":{"rank":1},"survival":{"rank":0},"thievery":{"rank":1}},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.iconics.Actor.psZZ5FZfDJv5MM51"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"qAVomN38laruCMhH","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/iconics/AmiriFull.webp","items":[{"_id":"ERgsYE6JqjO71Dgd","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/lore.svg","name":"Tanning Lore","sort":0,"system":{"description":{"value":""},"mod":{"value":0},"proficient":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"lore","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"prZ0atZHzl0OINKH","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.hFBwsVcSnNCJoimo"},"pf2e":{"itemGrants":{"diehard":{"id":"kLVi8LDpSQOefA69","onDelete":"detach"}}}},"img":"icons/environment/people/group.webp","name":"Versatile Heritage","sort":0,"system":{"ancestry":{"name":"Human","slug":"human","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.ancestries.Item.IiG7DgeLWYrSNXuX"},"description":{"value":"<p>Humanity's versatility and ambition have fueled its ascendance to be the most common ancestry in most nations throughout the world.

The natives of this brutal land are the nomadic Kellids, and they have made the best of this primal world. Amiri is one of these barbarians. Although she was blessed with a combination of independence and brawn, Amiri's childhood remained one of constant challenge. To the people of her tribe, the Six Bears, brawn and bravery were not ideal characteristics for a woman to have. To the Six Bears, a woman's role was simple—raise children, tend to the sick, and forge bonds with other tribes. Women were resources. When a tribe wished to form an alliance, they would send gifts of meat, furs, treasure, and daughters. Amiri didn't see herself as livestock, and every chance she got, she tried to one-up her brothers and cousins. When a hunter went out and caught a caribou for the tribe, she would go out and catch two. When a party of orc raiders stumbled into their hunting grounds and a tribal hero killed four, she took it upon herself to kill six. Her constant sense of competition made her few friends—her brothers were both intimidated by her ferocity and enthralled by her beauty, while her sisters knew that each time she went against tradition, they would all be punished.</p>\n<p>When Amiri finally came of age, her reputation had spread beyond the Six Bears. The other tribes took to calling her the \"Soft Chieftain\" of the Six Bears, a name that humiliated her almost as much as it did her kin, inferring that they were weak for allowing one of their women to grow so independent and strong. None of the other tribes wanted any part of her—her continued presence among the Six Bears caused much strife between once friendly tribes, and so the elders determined that there was but one choice—Amiri had to die. The only problem was the commonly held belief that murder of one's kin was the greatest taboo and the surest path to Hell.</p>\n<p>The opportunity to be rid of their troublesome sister rose soon enough, when word came of a tribe of frost giants who had been sighted in the nearby mountains. The elders organized a warband to scout the mountains and to drive back the giants, and they made sure that Amiri was included in the band. Shocked but proud to have finally been chosen, Amiri didn't notice how the elders smiled at her eagerness to be on her way. The elders knew that Amiri's sense of competition would swiftly get her in over her head, and in secret tasked the rest of the hunters to goad her into just such a situation.</p>\n<p>The warband headed up into the Kodar foothills, and it wasn't long before they found evidence of giants. One morning, the leader of the band rushed into camp, waving a dagger the size of a man's arm over his head. The warrior claimed to have single-handedly slain a giant and to have taken his dagger, and the others in the band congratulated him on his skill and bravery. Amiri took the bait, and announced that she would return by sundown with an even greater weapon. She could have no way of knowing that the dagger was part of the deception—that the warband had brought it with them as a prop to incite her into a foolish plan.</p>\n<p>What the warband themselves didn't anticipate was that Amiri would find a frost giant. After wandering the mountains, she came to an immense body at the foot of a cliff—the giant had fallen to his death weeks before, and at his side lay his immense bastard sword. Although Amiri knew that she had not killed the giant, she also knew that all she needed was his sword as proof—certainly her kin wouldn't think to dispute her claim with such a grand trophy. Yet when she returned to the place she had left her kin, she found the camp empty. Concerned, worried that they had fallen victim to the region's dangers, she tracked them, catching up with the warband halfway back to the tribal camp. As she approached the camp, though, she realized something was amiss—they were talking of her, and they were laughing.</p>\n<p>Creeping unseen to the edge of the camp, she realized that she had been duped. She heard her kin mocking her ways, of how she had fallen for their ruse, and how even now she was likely cooking in a giant's stewpot. That they seemed grateful and so at ease with her death was not what enraged Amiri. It was the proof that her own people thought of her as a fool that did it. Eyes blazing, Amiri stepped into the camp and held her new sword out, proclaiming that even now she had bested them. The other warriors, shocked to see her alive, quickly fell back to laughter, pointing out that she could hardly wield such an ungainly weapon. Her fury growing, Amiri hefted the weapon and tried to adopt a menacing pose, but the weapon's size threw her off balance and she toppled over, much to the other barbarian's growing amusement.</p>\n<p>It was enough. With a roar, Amiri leapt back to her feet. Her rage filled her body, clouded her vision, stole over her soul. Two of the barbarians had been decapitated by her immense sword before they realized that death had come. The battle was swift and brutal, with Amiri not noticing the blows that landed on her, simply stepping from one traitor to the next and cutting them down.</p>\n<p>When her rage finally subsided, Amiri realized what she had done. She knew that the hunters had certainly deserved their fates, but they were still kin. That her reasons for murdering them were, to her, valid didn't change the ties of blood. She knew that she had cut those ties, and so she turned her back on the remains, trusting that they would be discovered by another hunting party soon enough. As she headed west into the lands of Irrisen and the unknown reaches beyond, her heart was for the first time free—no longer was her future tied to traditions that would constrain her. She has come to value her oversized sword, and even though she can only truly wield it properly when her blood rage takes her, it has become as much a part of her as her fierce independence or her fiery heart. She no longer sees herself as a member of the Six Bears, but never speaks of the circumstances that forced her to flee her homeland.

Yet for Quinn himself, trained as a legal clerk and never having personally known the aristocratic comforts his parents mourned, this was no true inconvenience. What frustrated him about his nation was not that power resided with the people, but rather that it was wielded in such a capricious fashion. His fellow citizens' constant false accusations and refusal to abide by court rulings—not to mention the Gray Gardeners' tendency to pronounce sentences completely outside the system—drove young Quinn to distraction.</p>\n<p>When Quinn was 37, having recently lost both parents to an outbreak of plague, his simmering rage finally came to a head. After the ruling faction sentenced a man to death with flagrant disregard for due process, Quinn overstepped his usual role by investigating the matter himself, turning up irrefutable proof of the man's innocence. When his attempts to reopen the case were stymied, he returned the night before the scheduled execution and set the man free—only to run straight into a Gray Gardener patrol. The prisoner escaped in the ensuing fracas, and even as Quinn ran, he heard the Gardeners shouting his name.</p>\n<p>Quinn fled for the Taldan border, knowing that there was now a price on his head. Yet despite all he'd lost, he found himself laughing—for here, in this tragic debacle, he had finally discovered a sense of satisfaction he'd been missing his whole life. He had upheld the law and defended the innocent in spite of government negligence and corruption. By working outside the legal system, he'd helped guide it back toward a righteous path. And he wanted more.</p>\n<p>Thus began a new chapter in Quinn's life. Roaming the nations of the Inner Sea, he constantly keeps an ear out for allegations of unjust accusations or abuses of power. When he finds one, he investigates the case himself, using a lifetime of association with law enforcement agents and detective agencies like The Sleepless to help him ferret out the truth. If the legal system seems fair, he often shows up unexpectedly at the court proceedings, presenting sworn evidence and acting as defending counsel for the accused. If he finds a court to be corrupt, he takes a more direct hand in protecting the innocent. While he respects the law, he also knows that people are imperfect, and that breaking local laws is sometimes necessary in order to uphold more universal ones. Of course, his meddling is rarely popular with the opposition, and so Quinn generally moves along as soon as he's seen justice done and taken steps to ensure that the victim won't suffer further abuses.</p>\n<p>Quinn is a genial, gentlemanly sort, quick with a joke and able to fit easily into both high society and low. His well-honed analytical mind is capable of astounding feats of logic and deduction, and he's fond of sharpening it still further with alchemical extracts learned from his parents and his own personal studies. While formidable in combat, he uses a sword cane so as not to unduly tip off his enemies to his abilities, believing that the best weapon is the one your foe never sees coming. He's loyal to his friends, and sometimes seems to have a connection in every town, yet is also wary of associating too long or too openly with his allies, knowing that his fight for justice has made him unpopular with various powerful factions.</p>\n<p>Though now well into middle age, Quinn has no intentions of slowing down. As he's fond of telling companions, \"a man needs only three things to change the world: a quick wit, a righteous heart, and a stylish coat.\"</p>","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/deity.svg","value":""},"ethnicity":{"value":""},"gender":{"value":"M/He/Him"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"languages":{"details":"","value":["kelish","mwangi","osiriani","varisian","vudrani"]},"level":{"value":3},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":0},"arcana":{"rank":0},"athletics":{"rank":0},"crafting":{"rank":2},"deception":{"rank":1},"diplomacy":{"rank":1},"intimidation":{"rank":0},"medicine":{"rank":1},"nature":{"rank":1},"occultism":{"rank":1},"performance":{"rank":1},"religion":{"rank":1},"society":{"rank":2},"stealth":{"rank":2},"survival":{"rank":0},"thievery":{"rank":1}},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.iconics.Actor.QdSvlvxf8Lug5yvM"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"rki4jjgEtPNwoAa9","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/iconics/SeelahFull.webp","items":[{"_id":"SgRI5fYWoxnoCnWy","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.backgrounds.Item.moVRsnpjB5THCwxE"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/mystery-man.svg","name":"Street Urchin","sort":900000,"system":{"boosts":{"0":{"selected":"con","value":["con","dex"]},"1":{"selected":"cha","value":["cha","con","dex","int","str","wis"]}},"description":{"value":"<p>You eked out a living by picking pockets on the streets of a major city, never knowing where you'd find your next meal.

you revere above all others. The most common deities in Pathfinder appear on pages 35–39 of Player Core, along with their edicts, areas of concern, and the benefits you get for being a devotee of that deity. Choose one deity.</p><h2>Skill</h2><p>You become trained in the divine skill listed for your deity. As normal, if you're already trained in that skill, you become trained in a different skill of your choice.</p><h2>Anathema</h2><p>Champions care deeply about the edicts and anathema they take from their deity, sanctification, and cause. As with any implementation of edicts and anathema in the rules, these are a tool for roleplaying between you, the GM, and the other players at the table—you're still playing a nuanced character, not strictly following a script.</p>\n<p>Acts fundamentally opposed to your deity's ideals are anathema to your faith. Learning or casting spells, committing acts, and using items that are anathema to your deity remove you from your deity's good graces.</p>\n<p>Similarly, using items, spells, or actions that are anathema to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your connection to your deity. For example, assisting with a ritual that raises undead would be anathema to Pharasma, the goddess of death. Many actions that are anathema don't appear in any deity's formal list. For borderline cases, you and your GM determine which acts are anathema.</p>\n<p>If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. The class features that you lose are determined by the GM, but they likely include your holy or unholy trait, your focus pool, and your blessing of the devoted. These abilities can be regained only if you repent by conducting an atone ritual. If your deity doesn't require the specific sanctification you had, your GM might let you retrain your sanctification and cause while still following the same deity.</p><h2>Sanctification</h2><p>Depending on your deity, their sanctification can make you holy or unholy. This commits you to one side of a struggle over souls. Whether you become holy, unholy, or neither will limit your choice of causes, devotion spells, and feats.</p>\n<p>If you \"can be\" holy or unholy according to your deity's sanctification entry, you make that choice, and if you \"must be\" holy or unholy, you gain the trait automatically. If the deity lists \"none,\" you can choose only options that don't require the holy or unholy trait. If you are holy or unholy and gain the opposing trait in some way, you lose the previous trait until you atone.</p>\n<p>Unholy sanctification for a champion can be extremely disruptive to a typical game and should be a player character option only in appropriate adventures or campaigns where the group collectively decides to embrace them.

Certainly her numerous orders of paladins have risen swiftly to take on the vaunted role of paragon in many societies. Evangelical in their exuberance to spread word of her wisdom, Iomedae's missionaries were pivotal in the defense during the fabled Siege of Solku. They sacrificed their lives saving the town from gnoll slavers, and although none of them survived the siege, their presence lived on. Particularly in the eyes of young Seelah.</p>\n<p>Seelah's family came to the walled town of Solku as pilgrims fleeing the atrocities of distant Geb to the distant south. Unfortunately, they traded one peril for another, and within months of their settling in Solku, the gnolls of White Canyon began their infamous pillaging. Seelah's parents were slain in the first of these raids, leaving her orphaned at the age of 14 in a strange town. She did what she must to survive on the city streets, pickpocketing and bullying and even hiring herself out as a mercenary. When a group of Iomedae's knights arrived to defend Solku, Seelah was immediately taken with their beautiful, shining armor, and within an hour she had stolen a particularly fine mithral helm with a golden bird upon its brow. Yet then, something strange happened—Seelah became overwhelmed with guilt at her theft. For days, she agonized over the act, trying (and failing) several times to pawn the helm. During the Battle of Red Hail, Seelah realized that one of the bravest knights, a woman named Acemi with hair in long braids, fought the battle without her helm. This was the woman's undoing—in holding Solku's gates, she took a mortal wound to the skull from a gnoll's flail. The woman's heroism carried the day, but that evening she died of her wound.</p>\n<p>Wracked with guilt, Seelah approached Acemi's body as her companions prepared for her pyre. They watched silently as Seelah placed the stolen helm over the dead woman's head, and then climbed onto the pyre aside her to join her in death. The paladins were moved beyond words—they had known from the start that Seelah had stolen the helm, but Acemi had forbidden her brothers and sisters from collecting it, hoping that the helm would bring the desperate orphan enough money to survive for another few months. The knights of Iomedae took Seelah in that night. Although she has come to terms with Acemi's death, Seelah still regrets the theft that ironically brought her into Iomedae's arms. She originally came to Iomedae out of guilt, but in the past several years, that guilt has transformed into a powerful love and faith in the Inheritor.</p>\n<p>The young paladin wears her hair in Acemi's style and is trained in the use of the longsword. In so doing, she hopes to carry on the good work that Acemi might have done had she not fallen at the Battle of Red Hail. It's the least she feels she can do to make up for a death that she allowed to happen.</p>","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"class":{"value":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/icons/deity/Iomedae.webp","value":"Iomedae"},"ethnicity":{"value":""},"gender":{"value":"F/She/Her"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"languages":{"details":"","value":["common","osiriani"]},"level":{"min":1,"value":3},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"focus":{"value":1},"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"rank":0,"value":0},"reflex":{"rank":0,"value":0},"will":{"rank":0,"value":0}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":0},"arcana":{"rank":0},"athletics":{"rank":1},"crafting":{"rank":0},"deception":{"rank":0},"diplomacy":{"rank":1},"intimidation":{"rank":1},"medicine":{"rank":0},"nature":{"rank":0},"occultism":{"rank":0},"performance":{"rank":0},"religion":{"rank":0},"society":{"rank":1},"stealth":{"rank":1},"survival":{"rank":0},"thievery":{"rank":1}},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.iconics.Actor.rki4jjgEtPNwoAa9"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"ROOYL5i5ASKem0j8","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/iconics/LiniFull.webp","items":[{"_id":"NimM8csExNjhJz7E","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/lore.svg","name":"Herbalism Lore","sort":0,"system":{"description":{"value":""},"mod":{"value":0},"proficient":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"lore","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"H8J6HH7OzFDqCuWm","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.ancestries.Item.CYlfsYLJcBOgqKtD"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/alternatives/ancestries/gnome.svg","name":"Gnome","sort":0,"system":{"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"custom":"","value":["draconic","dwarven","elven","goblin","jotun","orcish"]},"boosts":{"0":{"value":["cha"]},"1":{"value":["con"]},"2":{"selected":"wis","value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"description":{"value":"<p><em>Long ago, early gnome ancestors emigrated from the First World, realm of the fey.

More than once, Lini's traveling companions or enclave came under threat from some great bear or razor-clawed cat, but with a series of soothing noises and precise motions Lini always tamed the beast and sent it on its way.</p>\n<p>Lini's success at calming animals came to an end one day when a snow leopard bound out of the trees and pinned her to the ground before she could react. Her friends scattered, leaving Lini alone to face the beast. Although fascinated by the cat's power and speed, and appreciative of the animal's beauty, Lini trembled under her massive paw and tears leaked from her eyes. She knew she faced her doom, and she found it cruelly ironic how death came to claim her.</p>\n<p>Yet the leopard did not strike.</p>\n<p>\"Your friends have abandoned you,\" a calm feminine voice intoned out of Lini's sight. \"Despite the times you saved them, they left you to die.\" Although Lini could not see the woman, Lini knew of the Norn of the forest and suspected she was one of them.</p>\n<p>\"Please help me,\" Lini whispered, her chest struggling to rise under the great cat's crushing paw.</p>\n<p>\"You do not need my help, little one. You need hers.\"</p>\n<p>Lini looked at the snow leopard, deep into her eyes. She saw neither hunger or malice. Still struggling just to breathe, Lini stared into the great cat's eyes and asked, \"Will you help me?\"</p>\n<p>Inexplicably, the snow leopard lifted her paw from Lini's chest. A coughing fit then overcame the small gnome, and when she finally recovered she looked around her. The snow leopard was gone and Lini saw no sign of the Norn. She looked around frantically, suddenly alone and scared. A small gnome in a large world.</p>\n<p>\"Come back,\" Lini cried. \"Don't go! Please don't go. Don't leave me alone.\" She sank to her knees, tears afresh on her face, until she heard the sound of approaching footsteps.</p>\n<p>The snow leopard had returned. With the delicateness of a mother tending to her cubs, the great cat licked gently at Lini's face, whisking away her tears. Lini threw her arms around the leopard's neck. \"You are my friend, aren't you? I will call you Droogami. That is what we call good friends.\"</p>\n<p>Lini looked down then and picked up a stick from the forest floor before clambering up the cat's side to perch on its back.</p>\n<p>\"Let us go, then, Droogami. We have no need for this place.\"</p>\n<p>In the years since her departure from the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, Lini has collected more than a dozen sticks—one from each forest or wood she visits. In her resting time after long days of travel, she sits at Droogami's side and peels the bark from the sticks, smoothing and polishing them incessantly.</p>","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/deity.svg","value":""},"ethnicity":{"value":""},"gender":{"value":"F/She/Her"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"languages":{"details":"","value":[]},"level":{"value":3},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"focus":{"value":1},"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":0},"arcana":{"rank":0},"athletics":{"rank":0},"crafting":{"rank":0},"deception":{"rank":0},"diplomacy":{"rank":1},"intimidation":{"rank":0},"medicine":{"rank":0},"nature":{"rank":2},"occultism":{"rank":0},"performance":{"rank":0},"religion":{"rank":0},"society":{"rank":0},"stealth":{"rank":1},"survival":{"rank":1},"thievery":{"rank":0}},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.iconics.Actor.ROOYL5i5ASKem0j8"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"sLs5dYDNg0WzGMyP","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/iconics/HarskFull.webp","items":[{"_id":"i49QhtMMGL3swBxM","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/lore.svg","name":"Forest Lore","sort":0,"system":{"description":{"value":""},"mod":{"value":0},"proficient":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"lore","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"mL5VYLWWrv7HO3yu","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.ancestries.Item.BYj5ZvlXZdpaEgA6"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/alternatives/ancestries/dwarf.svg","name":"Dwarf","sort":0,"system":{"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"custom":"","value":["gnomish","goblin","jotun","orcish","petran","sakvroth"]},"boosts":{"0":{"value":["con"]},"1":{"value":["wis"]},"2":{"selected":"str","value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"description":{"value":"<p><em>Dwarves have a well-earned reputation as a stoic and stern people, ensconced within citadels and cities carved from solid rock.

all dwarves are meant for the mines. As a young dwarf, Harsk spent every spare moment outdoors under the wide skies of southeastern Varisia, particularly at night beneath the stars, where his keen vision made him a hunter without compare. While generally uninterested in his family's traditional smithing, he still inherited enough of their tinkering ability to construct his own crossbow, a heavy, highly accurate weapon that few others are able to wind. Eschewing the company of his fellows, few things made Harsk happier than crouching in a tree stand with his bow, listening to the wind through the forest leaves and waiting for deer or larger prey to wander by.</p>\n<p>That all changed twenty years ago, when his elder brother, a fine captain named Sigur, led a dwarven war band from Janderhoff against a small party of giants that had descended from the Mindspin Mountains to raid and pillage. Out of affection, Sigur offered his less-experienced sibling the chance to come and prove himself as Sigur's chief scout and second-in-command. Calm and peaceful by nature, Harsk turned him down, failing to see the honor his brother was doing him until several days after the company had departed. Traveling light and fast, Harsk caught up with his brother quickly—but not quickly enough. Misjudging the size and skill of the raiding party, Sigur led his band into an ambush, where it was slaughtered to the last dwarf.</p>\n<p>With his brother's blood still fresh on his hands, Harsk went mad with rage. That night, he stalked through the giants' camp like a vengeful wraith, slaughtering giant after giant with his crossbow before melting back into the forest, only to reappear elsewhere and take another victim. When the last giant was left gurgling in the dust, Harsk took up his brother's axe and slipped off into the trees, vowing to forever be the voice of justice in the wild places, to keep balance and prevent the sacrifices of noble men like his brother.</p>\n<p>Harsk, like many of his kind, is gruff and taciturn, but there ends most of his connection to dwarven society. Something of a loner, he prefers to spend his time outdoors, communing with nature, though he occasionally travels alongside others whose goals match his own. Uninterested in the beer and ale that so characterize dwarves in the minds of human society, Harsk instead drinks pot after pot of strong tea to keep his senses sharp. While he never lets his brother's axe out of his sight, he wields it only as a last resort, knowing that his true skills lie in the hunt and striking from darkness.</p>","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/deity.svg","value":""},"ethnicity":{"value":""},"gender":{"value":"M/He/Him"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"dex"},"languages":{"details":"","value":[]},"level":{"value":1},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":1},"arcana":{"rank":0},"athletics":{"rank":1},"crafting":{"rank":1},"deception":{"rank":0},"diplomacy":{"rank":0},"intimidation":{"rank":1},"medicine":{"rank":0},"nature":{"rank":0},"occultism":{"rank":0},"performance":{"rank":0},"religion":{"rank":0},"society":{"rank":0},"stealth":{"rank":1},"survival":{"rank":0},"thievery":{"rank":0}},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.iconics.Actor.sLs5dYDNg0WzGMyP"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"TMDFyqQtryffdHvE","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/iconics/ValerosFull.webp","items":[{"_id":"4QKHaQdbGltG9HsO","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/lore.svg","name":"Farming Lore","sort":0,"system":{"description":{"value":""},"mod":{"value":0},"proficient":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"lore","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"5rlfnozppburd7f8","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.3lgwjrFEsQVKzhh7"}},"img":"icons/containers/bags/pack-leather-white-tan.webp","name":"Backpack","sort":0,"system":{"baseItem":null,"bulk":{"capacity":4,"heldOrStowed":0.1,"ignored":2,"value":0},"collapsed":false,"containerId":null,"description":{"value":"<p>A backpack holds up to 4 Bulk of items and the first 2 Bulk of these items don't count against your Bulk limits.

Though this longing only increased as he grew older, so too did the demands of helping his aging parents run the farm, and slowly but surely the mounting responsibilities of agricultural life quashed any possibility of travel or seeing the world. Finally, just a month before a marriage of convenience to a local farmer's daughter could lock him into place (but not before he'd sampled a few of the joys of married life), Valeros came to the realization that the door to a storybook life of adventure was at last closing for good. Seized by a sudden, desperate need for a larger life than cattle and corn, Valeros packed quietly and left in the middle of the night with no more than a change of clothes, some pilfered food, and an old axe handle to discourage any ruffians who might seek to divest him of either. It was to become a theme that would follow him for the rest of his life.</p>\n<p>In the years since, Valeros has come a long way from the wide-eyed young man who sought only the joy of exploration (and maybe a pretty, worldly girl or three to regale with his stories). Life on the road, it seems, is much harder than the bards' tales, and adult Valeros has the scars to prove it. Discovering himself to be a deft hand with a sword, Valeros quickly fell in with the rough-and-tumble mercenary crowd, there learning the dirtier, grittier facts of warfare. Though none could deny his prowess with a blade (or better yet, two), Valeros's association with various mercenary groups never seemed to last for long. There was his time as a guard for the Aspis Consortium, which ended when certain shipments kept coming in light under Valeros's watch (never mind that the exploited locals were dying for lack of grain, and only needed a little to make it through the winter). Then there was the stint as a freelance bounty hunter, during which Valeros discovered that it's a lot easier to hunt down escaped murderers than it is to haul in a young woman on the run from a loveless marriage. And of course, there was the infamous incident with the Band of the Mauler, to which Valeros will only say that he was positive their leader had been crushed under that cave-in, or else he never would have touched the man's wife.</p>\n<p>In the end, after acting as hired muscle for dozens of different employers, Valeros finally realized that the only way to keep from getting blamed for things which weren't his fault—not really—was to go into business for himself as an adventurer, traveling with those who properly appreciated him and letting those who didn't fall by the wayside. And if some of those companions happen to be pretty women, such as a certain Varisian sorcerer or elven rogue, all the better.</p>\n<p>While admittedly not the best at following orders, Valeros is an extremely talented two-blade fighter, easily earning his keep in any group through the tenacity and absolute fearlessness—some might say thoughtlessness—with which he flings himself into combat. Despite his reputation as a bruiser and scofflaw, Valeros has picked up a fair bit of education here and there during his travels, and can even read (something his \"respectable\" parents never learned to do). A worshiper of Cayden Cailean—the only god who properly understands the need for freedom in the common man's existence—Valeros takes an easy-come, easy-go approach to life, wealth, and relationships. Though a fan of fine weapons and creature comforts, the only object he's never without is the tankard on his belt (for you never know when someone might offer you a drink). Noble at heart, and fiercely loyal to those few who manage the considerable feat of establishing themselves in his affections, Valeros nevertheless hides such sentiments under a jaded and crass demeanor, frequently observing that there's nothing better than \"an evening of hard drinking and soft company.\"</p>","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/deity.svg","value":""},"ethnicity":{"value":""},"gender":{"value":"M/He/Him"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"languages":{"details":"","value":["goblin","kelish"]},"level":{"value":5},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":1},"arcana":{"rank":0},"athletics":{"rank":2},"crafting":{"rank":1},"deception":{"rank":0},"diplomacy":{"rank":1},"intimidation":{"rank":2},"medicine":{"rank":0},"nature":{"rank":0},"occultism":{"rank":1},"performance":{"rank":0},"religion":{"rank":0},"society":{"rank":0},"stealth":{"rank":0},"survival":{"rank":0},"thievery":{"rank":0}},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.iconics.Actor.TMDFyqQtryffdHvE"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"UznKHAei13XNsMUP","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/iconics/DroogamiFull.webp","items":[{"_id":"DJzgv1auNSTIZIwE","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e-animal-companions.AC-Ancestries-and-Class.Item.lOzvLCCy9QRnYw6w"},"pf2e":{"itemGrants":{"animalCompanion":{"id":"u8ZmvtTqMMajZty9","onDelete":"detach"},"catSupportBenefit":{"id":"AWnI4xJIdR3KMbBU","onDelete":"detach"}}}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/ancestry.svg","name":"Cat","sort":0,"system":{"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"custom":"","value":[]},"boosts":{"0":{"value":[]},"1":{"value":[]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"description":{"value":"<p>Your companion is a big cat, such as a leopard or tiger.</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Small</p>\n<p><strong>Melee</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> jaws (finesse), <strong>Damage</strong> 1d6 piercing</p>\n<p><strong>Melee</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> claw (agile, finesse), <strong>Damage</strong> 1d4 slashing</p>\n<p><strong>Str</strong> +2, <strong>Dex</strong> +3, <strong>Con</strong> +1, <strong>Int</strong> -4, <strong>Wis</strong> +2, <strong>Cha</strong> +0</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 4</p>\n<p><strong>Skill</strong> Stealth</p>\n<p><strong>Senses</strong> low-light vision, scent (imprecise, 30 feet)</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 35 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> Your cat deals 1d4 extra precision damage against off-guard targets.</p>\n<p><strong>Support Benefit</strong> Your cat throws your enemies off-balance when you create an opening.

Though this longing only increased as he grew older, so too did the demands of helping his aging parents run the farm, and slowly but surely the mounting responsibilities of agricultural life quashed any possibility of travel or seeing the world. Finally, just a month before a marriage of convenience to a local farmer's daughter could lock him into place (but not before he'd sampled a few of the joys of married life), Valeros came to the realization that the door to a storybook life of adventure was at last closing for good. Seized by a sudden, desperate need for a larger life than cattle and corn, Valeros packed quietly and left in the middle of the night with no more than a change of clothes, some pilfered food, and an old axe handle to discourage any ruffians who might seek to divest him of either. It was to become a theme that would follow him for the rest of his life.</p>\n<p>In the years since, Valeros has come a long way from the wide-eyed young man who sought only the joy of exploration (and maybe a pretty, worldly girl or three to regale with his stories). Life on the road, it seems, is much harder than the bards' tales, and adult Valeros has the scars to prove it. Discovering himself to be a deft hand with a sword, Valeros quickly fell in with the rough-and-tumble mercenary crowd, there learning the dirtier, grittier facts of warfare. Though none could deny his prowess with a blade (or better yet, two), Valeros's association with various mercenary groups never seemed to last for long. There was his time as a guard for the Aspis Consortium, which ended when certain shipments kept coming in light under Valeros's watch (never mind that the exploited locals were dying for lack of grain, and only needed a little to make it through the winter). Then there was the stint as a freelance bounty hunter, during which Valeros discovered that it's a lot easier to hunt down escaped murderers than it is to haul in a young woman on the run from a loveless marriage. And of course, there was the infamous incident with the Band of the Mauler, to which Valeros will only say that he was positive their leader had been crushed under that cave-in, or else he never would have touched the man's wife.</p>\n<p>In the end, after acting as hired muscle for dozens of different employers, Valeros finally realized that the only way to keep from getting blamed for things which weren't his fault—not really—was to go into business for himself as an adventurer, traveling with those who properly appreciated him and letting those who didn't fall by the wayside. And if some of those companions happen to be pretty women, such as a certain Varisian sorcerer or elven rogue, all the better.</p>\n<p>While admittedly not the best at following orders, Valeros is an extremely talented two-blade fighter, easily earning his keep in any group through the tenacity and absolute fearlessness—some might say thoughtlessness—with which he flings himself into combat. Despite his reputation as a bruiser and scofflaw, Valeros has picked up a fair bit of education here and there during his travels, and can even read (something his \"respectable\" parents never learned to do). A worshiper of Cayden Cailean—the only god who properly understands the need for freedom in the common man's existence—Valeros takes an easy-come, easy-go approach to life, wealth, and relationships. Though a fan of fine weapons and creature comforts, the only object he's never without is the tankard on his belt (for you never know when someone might offer you a drink). Noble at heart, and fiercely loyal to those few who manage the considerable feat of establishing themselves in his affections, Valeros nevertheless hides such sentiments under a jaded and crass demeanor, frequently observing that there's nothing better than \"an evening of hard drinking and soft company.\"</p>","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/deity.svg","value":""},"ethnicity":{"value":""},"gender":{"value":"M/He/Him"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"languages":{"details":"","value":["goblin","kelish"]},"level":{"value":1},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":1},"arcana":{"rank":0},"athletics":{"rank":0},"crafting":{"rank":1},"deception":{"rank":0},"diplomacy":{"rank":1},"intimidation":{"rank":0},"medicine":{"rank":0},"nature":{"rank":0},"occultism":{"rank":1},"performance":{"rank":0},"religion":{"rank":0},"society":{"rank":0},"stealth":{"rank":0},"survival":{"rank":0},"thievery":{"rank":0}},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.iconics.Actor.vcwqnXHkhzFhrt7O"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"VKiNcykRfwWGY21s","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/iconics/DroogamiFull.webp","items":[{"_id":"eoAI7N6RVscEja17","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e-animal-companions.AC-Ancestries-and-Class.Item.lOzvLCCy9QRnYw6w"},"pf2e":{"itemGrants":{"animalCompanion":{"id":"09K7kZlseBl6crQH","onDelete":"detach"},"catSupportBenefit":{"id":"Yq8IEfCn7s2lN8x5","onDelete":"detach"}}}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/ancestry.svg","name":"Cat","sort":0,"system":{"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"custom":"","value":[]},"boosts":{"0":{"value":[]},"1":{"value":[]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"description":{"value":"<p>Your companion is a big cat, such as a leopard or tiger.</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Small</p>\n<p><strong>Melee</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> jaws (finesse), <strong>Damage</strong> 1d6 piercing</p>\n<p><strong>Melee</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> claw (agile, finesse), <strong>Damage</strong> 1d4 slashing</p>\n<p><strong>Str</strong> +2, <strong>Dex</strong> +3, <strong>Con</strong> +1, <strong>Int</strong> -4, <strong>Wis</strong> +2, <strong>Cha</strong> +0</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 4</p>\n<p><strong>Skill</strong> Stealth</p>\n<p><strong>Senses</strong> low-light vision, scent (imprecise, 30 feet)</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 35 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> Your cat deals 1d4 extra precision damage against off-guard targets.</p>\n<p><strong>Support Benefit</strong> Your cat throws your enemies off-balance when you create an opening.

Though this longing only increased as he grew older, so too did the demands of helping his aging parents run the farm, and slowly but surely the mounting responsibilities of agricultural life quashed any possibility of travel or seeing the world. Finally, just a month before a marriage of convenience to a local farmer's daughter could lock him into place (but not before he'd sampled a few of the joys of married life), Valeros came to the realization that the door to a storybook life of adventure was at last closing for good. Seized by a sudden, desperate need for a larger life than cattle and corn, Valeros packed quietly and left in the middle of the night with no more than a change of clothes, some pilfered food, and an old axe handle to discourage any ruffians who might seek to divest him of either. It was to become a theme that would follow him for the rest of his life.</p>\n<p>In the years since, Valeros has come a long way from the wide-eyed young man who sought only the joy of exploration (and maybe a pretty, worldly girl or three to regale with his stories). Life on the road, it seems, is much harder than the bards' tales, and adult Valeros has the scars to prove it. Discovering himself to be a deft hand with a sword, Valeros quickly fell in with the rough-and-tumble mercenary crowd, there learning the dirtier, grittier facts of warfare. Though none could deny his prowess with a blade (or better yet, two), Valeros's association with various mercenary groups never seemed to last for long. There was his time as a guard for the Aspis Consortium, which ended when certain shipments kept coming in light under Valeros's watch (never mind that the exploited locals were dying for lack of grain, and only needed a little to make it through the winter). Then there was the stint as a freelance bounty hunter, during which Valeros discovered that it's a lot easier to hunt down escaped murderers than it is to haul in a young woman on the run from a loveless marriage. And of course, there was the infamous incident with the Band of the Mauler, to which Valeros will only say that he was positive their leader had been crushed under that cave-in, or else he never would have touched the man's wife.</p>\n<p>In the end, after acting as hired muscle for dozens of different employers, Valeros finally realized that the only way to keep from getting blamed for things which weren't his fault—not really—was to go into business for himself as an adventurer, traveling with those who properly appreciated him and letting those who didn't fall by the wayside. And if some of those companions happen to be pretty women, such as a certain Varisian sorcerer or elven rogue, all the better.</p>\n<p>While admittedly not the best at following orders, Valeros is an extremely talented two-blade fighter, easily earning his keep in any group through the tenacity and absolute fearlessness—some might say thoughtlessness—with which he flings himself into combat. Despite his reputation as a bruiser and scofflaw, Valeros has picked up a fair bit of education here and there during his travels, and can even read (something his \"respectable\" parents never learned to do). A worshiper of Cayden Cailean—the only god who properly understands the need for freedom in the common man's existence—Valeros takes an easy-come, easy-go approach to life, wealth, and relationships. Though a fan of fine weapons and creature comforts, the only object he's never without is the tankard on his belt (for you never know when someone might offer you a drink). Noble at heart, and fiercely loyal to those few who manage the considerable feat of establishing themselves in his affections, Valeros nevertheless hides such sentiments under a jaded and crass demeanor, frequently observing that there's nothing better than \"an evening of hard drinking and soft company.\"</p>","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/deity.svg","value":""},"ethnicity":{"value":""},"gender":{"value":"M/He/Him"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"languages":{"details":"","value":["goblin","kelish"]},"level":{"value":3},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":1},"arcana":{"rank":0},"athletics":{"rank":2},"crafting":{"rank":1},"deception":{"rank":0},"diplomacy":{"rank":1},"intimidation":{"rank":1},"medicine":{"rank":0},"nature":{"rank":0},"occultism":{"rank":1},"performance":{"rank":0},"religion":{"rank":0},"society":{"rank":0},"stealth":{"rank":0},"survival":{"rank":0},"thievery":{"rank":0}},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.iconics.Actor.vmLKgEKk0a7DpJDP"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"WNX5OQKPh4uaV7mW","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/iconics/EzrenFull.webp","items":[{"_id":"cfA9kAjXXnyFAQYh","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/lore.svg","name":"Mercantile Lore","sort":0,"system":{"description":{"value":""},"mod":{"value":0},"proficient":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"lore","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"YwR7DFTQ8sAYZz9W","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.ancestries.Item.IiG7DgeLWYrSNXuX"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/alternatives/ancestries/human.svg","name":"Human","sort":0,"system":{"additionalLanguages":{"count":1,"custom":"","value":[]},"boosts":{"0":{"selected":"int","value":["cha","con","dex","int","str","wis"]},"1":{"selected":"dex","value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]},"2":{"value":[]}},"description":{"value":"<p><em>As unpredictable and varied as any of Golarion's peoples, humans have exceptional drive and the capacity to endure and expand.

In other cases, there's never a choice at all—being raised on the streets leaves few other options available for those who do not wish to become criminals. Rarest are those who come to adventuring late in life.</p>\n<p>This was Ezren's path to adventure. Born to a successful spice merchant in one of Absalom's more affluent districts, Ezren's childhood was pleasantly safe. As the fourth of six siblings, he never knew the responsibility implicit in being the eldest (and therefore the one expected to carry on father's trade) or the freedom of being the youngest. He enjoyed the comforts of a well-to-do family, lived in a neighborhood relatively safe from crime, and seemed poised for a life of mediocrity.</p>\n<p>That changed when his father was taken away, charged with heresy by the church of Abadar. The charges were too spurious to stick, and while his father escaped excommunication, the damage had been done—his father's business fell to pieces. Shocked, dismayed, and convinced that his father was innocent, Ezren abandoned his future and spent his adult life trying to repair his father's ruined reputation. So when Ezren finally uncovered irrefutable proof of his father's guilt, and he realized he'd wasted his life on a lie, he turned his evidence over to the church and said goodbye to his home, his family, and his life.</p>\n<p>At the age of 42, Ezren is full aware that he's missed his adulthood, yet at the same time he looks forward to discovering the world, and making a difference for a cause that he believes in. His dissatisfaction with family, religion, and government left him precious little to trust but his own intellect—in fighting for his father's redemption, he had become a gifted researcher, scholar, and intellectual. Lacking the spry limbs of youth, the trust in religion, the strong arm of the soldier, or the way with words of the politician, Ezren felt he had but one option open. He traveled to tarnished Oppara, capital of Taldor and one of the oldest cities of the continent of Avistan, hoping to join one of several prestigious schools of wizardry. Yet time and time again, he was turned away due to his age. No wizard seemed to want an apprentice who, in many cases, was older than them. So Ezren was forced to strike out on his own once again.</p>\n<p>Over the next decade, as he traveled Avistan, Ezren studied where he could, picking up tricks of the wizard's trade here and there. The combination of arcane study mixed with his worldly first-hand experiences have given him an edge over young wizards fresh out of apprenticeship and eager to make names for themselves. Ezren knows about the many ways the world can trick and betray you, but now he's finally begun to master the art of magic, giving him the tools to fight back.</p>","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/deity.svg","value":""},"ethnicity":{"value":"Varisian"},"gender":{"value":"M/He/Him"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"languages":{"details":"","value":["draconic","dwarven","halfling","sakvroth","varisian"]},"level":{"value":1},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":1},"arcana":{"rank":0},"athletics":{"rank":0},"crafting":{"rank":1},"deception":{"rank":0},"diplomacy":{"rank":0},"intimidation":{"rank":0},"medicine":{"rank":0},"nature":{"rank":1},"occultism":{"rank":1},"performance":{"rank":0},"religion":{"rank":1},"society":{"rank":1},"stealth":{"rank":0},"survival":{"rank":1},"thievery":{"rank":0}},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.iconics.Actor.WNX5OQKPh4uaV7mW"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"XaBCp3DygrjJaqR7","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/iconics/YoonFull.webp","items":[{"_id":"GLbRpGniarZwqoUM","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.ancestries.Item.IiG7DgeLWYrSNXuX"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/alternatives/ancestries/human.svg","name":"Human","sort":0,"system":{"additionalLanguages":{"count":1,"custom":"","value":[]},"boosts":{"0":{"selected":"dex","value":["cha","con","dex","int","str","wis"]},"1":{"selected":"con","value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]},"2":{"value":[]}},"description":{"value":"<p><em>As unpredictable and varied as any of Golarion's peoples, humans have exceptional drive and the capacity to endure and expand.

You can choose either a single gate (one element) or dual gate (two elements) at 1st level.</p>\n<p>When selecting an element for your kinetic gate, you can pick from six elements - air, earth, fire metal, water, and wood. Elements you can channel are referred to as your kinetic elements. Your kinetic elements function even in environments where they normally wouldn't. For example, you could use fire actions underwater even though that's normally not possible, and you could create air in a vacuum.</p>\n<p>Your kinetic gate gives you impulse feats, magical actions that let you shape and control your elements in awesome ways. You can select more impulse feats using your kineticist class feats, as described under Impulses. At higher levels, the gate's threshold class feature gives you more impulse feats and lets you choose whether to improve with one element or access new kinetic elements.</p>\n<h3><strong>Single Gate</strong></h3>\n<p>Your kinetic gate links to a single elemental plane, starting you with a single element but giving you greater power with it. Choose one element to be your kinetic element, and select two 1st-level impulse feats that have that element's trait.</p>\n<p>In addition, you gain an impulse junction, a benefit that occurs when you use an impulse of the chosen element that takes 2 actions or more. This happens before the other effects of the impulse, unless noted otherwise. You can gain only one impulse junction per round; they are described in full below.</p>\n<p><strong>Air</strong> Before or after the other effects of the impulse, you can either Stride up to half your Speed or Step.

Until the start of your next turn, each time a creature touches you or damages you with an unarmed melee attack or nonreach melee weapon, it takes damage of the chosen type equal to half your level (minimum 1 damage).</p>\n<p><strong>Water</strong> After the impulse's other effects, you can move one creature targeted by the impulse or in its area 5 feet in any direction, or 10 feet if it's in a body of water. This can't move the creature into the air. You can choose only a creature that's willing to be moved, that failed its save against the impulse, or that you succeeded at an impulse attack roll against.</p>\n<p><strong>Wood</strong> You gain temporary Hit Points equal to your level that last until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<h3><strong>Dual Gate</strong></h3>\n<p>Your kinetic gate is a harmonious conduit between two planes, allowing you to combine their elements to give you a versatile set of abilities.

To wield an element, you must have your kinetic aura active and have a free hand, as described in the impulse trait. You automatically gain the Elemental Blast and Base Kinesis impulses, and your kinetic gate selection gives you additional impulse feats. You can select more impulse feats with kineticist class feats, and at higher levels, you'll automatically get more with the gate's threshold class feature. You can select an impulse feat only if it matches one of your kinetic elements.</p>\n<p>Impulses are magical, and though they aren't spells, some things that affect spells also affect impulses. Abilities that restrict you from casting spells (such as being polymorphed into a battle form) or protect against spells (such as a spell that protects against other spells or a creature's bonus to saves against spells) also apply to impulses.</p>\n<h3><strong>Impulse Levels</strong></h3>\n<p>Any impulse you use is the same level you are. For instance, if you're 5th level, your Elemental Blast would be 5th level (and its counteract rank would be 3rd rank), even though you gained the action at 1st level.</p>\n<p>Similar to spells, many impulses get more powerful as you increase in level. In these cases, the impulse ends with one or more \"Level\" entries. This either lists the levels at which the impulse gets an upgrade or has an entry with a plus sign that describes a benefit that increases on a regular basis. For instance, a 1st-level impulse with a \"Level (+4)\" entry would get stronger at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.</p>\n<h3><strong>Impulse Attacks and DCs</strong></h3>\n<p>An impulse that requires a saving throw uses your kineticist class DC. Some of your impulses require you to attempt an <strong>impulse attack roll</strong> to see how effective they are. Your impulse attack roll uses the same proficiency and attribute modifier as your kineticist class DC. Like a spell attack modifier, your impulse attack modifier uses the following formula: d20 roll + attribute modifier + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties. This means your impulse attack roll is typically 10 lower than your class DC. The @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained} condition can reduce your impulse attack rolls and class DCs. You can acquire a <em>gate attenuator</em> to gain a bonus to your impulse attack modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Elemental Blast</strong></h3>\n<p>The @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.6lbr0Jnv0zMB5uGb]{Elemental Blast} impulse is a simple expression of your power, allowing you to attack with the pure matter of your kinetic element.

As a druid, your spellcasting incantations might be pleas to the environment around you or the invocation of ancient vows; your hands might sway like willows or curl into clawlike shapes as your gestures direct your magic. At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the common spells on the primal spell list, or from other primal spells to which you gain access and learn via Learn a Spell.

Since your key attribute is Wisdom, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<h2>Heightening Spells</h2>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells.

A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of druid spell slot you have.

More than once, Lini's traveling companions or enclave came under threat from some great bear or razor-clawed cat, but with a series of soothing noises and precise motions Lini always tamed the beast and sent it on its way.</p>\n<p>Lini's success at calming animals came to an end one day when a snow leopard bound out of the trees and pinned her to the ground before she could react. Her friends scattered, leaving Lini alone to face the beast. Although fascinated by the cat's power and speed, and appreciative of the animal's beauty, Lini trembled under her massive paw and tears leaked from her eyes. She knew she faced her doom, and she found it cruelly ironic how death came to claim her.</p>\n<p>Yet the leopard did not strike.</p>\n<p>\"Your friends have abandoned you,\" a calm feminine voice intoned out of Lini's sight. \"Despite the times you saved them, they left you to die.\" Although Lini could not see the woman, Lini knew of the Norn of the forest and suspected she was one of them.</p>\n<p>\"Please help me,\" Lini whispered, her chest struggling to rise under the great cat's crushing paw.</p>\n<p>\"You do not need my help, little one. You need hers.\"</p>\n<p>Lini looked at the snow leopard, deep into her eyes. She saw neither hunger or malice. Still struggling just to breathe, Lini stared into the great cat's eyes and asked, \"Will you help me?\"</p>\n<p>Inexplicably, the snow leopard lifted her paw from Lini's chest. A coughing fit then overcame the small gnome, and when she finally recovered she looked around her. The snow leopard was gone and Lini saw no sign of the Norn. She looked around frantically, suddenly alone and scared. A small gnome in a large world.</p>\n<p>\"Come back,\" Lini cried. \"Don't go! Please don't go.

At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank spells of your choice and four cantrips of your choice, as well as an additional spell and cantrip from your bloodline. You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your bloodline, or from other spells from that tradition to which you have access.

At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank spells of your choice and five cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your eidolon, or from other spells from that tradition to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell rank. Your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it doesn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2–4: Summoner Spells per Day), you add a spell of the same rank to your spell repertoire. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell. At 3rd level, you add the first 2nd-rank spell to your repertoire. At 4th level you gain your second and your spell repertoire reaches its maximum size of five spells.</p>\n<p>At 5th level, in addition to adding two 3rd-rank spells to your repertoire, you lose your lowest rank of spell slots. Any time you lose a rank of spell slots, you lose two spells in your repertoire as well. These can come from spells you already know or out of the number of new spells you're learning. On levels in which you don't change your spell slots, you can swap out multiple spells, as described below.</p>\n<p><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></p>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned.

You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<p>At 6th level and every even level thereafter, you can swap out any number of your spells for different spells of a rank you can cast. When you do, you must keep at least one spell you can cast with your lowest rank of spell slots so you don't end up with slots you can't use. For instance, at 6th level you would need to keep at least one 2nd-rank spell, but all your other spells could be 3rd rank.</p>"},"level":{"value":1},"location":"H9mEr51MjkHUbCTM","prerequisites":{"value":[]},"publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Player Core"},"rules":[{"itemId":"{item|id}","key":"ItemAlteration","mode":"override","property":"description","value":[{"text":"PF2E.SpecificRule.ClassFeatures.SpellRepertoire.{actor|class.slug}.PartOne"},{"text":"PF2E.SpecificRule.ClassFeatures.SpellRepertoire.{actor|class.slug}.PartTwo"},{"text":"PF2E.SpecificRule.ClassFeatures.SpellRepertoire.{actor|class.slug}.PartThree"},{"divider":true,"text":"PF2E.SpecificRule.ClassFeatures.SpellRepertoire.SpellSwapping"},{"text":"PF2E.SpecificRule.ClassFeatures.SpellRepertoire.{actor|class.slug}.SpellSwapping"}]},{"itemId":"{item|id}","key":"ItemAlteration","mode":"add","property":"traits","value":"{actor|class.slug}"}],"slug":"spell-repertoire","traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["bard","oracle","psychic","sorcerer","summoner"]},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"feat","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"VDP14Lf0YxdNLDhJ","img":"icons/weapons/axes/axe-double-gold.webp","name":"Oracle Spellcasting","sort":0,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"classfeature","description":{"value":"<p>You have an unfiltered connection to the great powers of the universe and the planes beyond, and you can let this power spill forth in the form of divine magic.

When he was but an egg, his family left the tengu homeland of Kwanlai, first trekking west to the port city of Goka before boarding a ship to the Inner Sea in search for a better life. Like many immigrants from Tian Xia, they headed for Absalom; however, where they eventually settled was not the City at the Center of the World, but the nearby Isle of Erran.</p>\n<p>Korakai hatched and grew up on those shores, running barefoot on the beaches and rocks. Each day, his mother would dive beneath the waves, holding her breath to collect shellfish, seaweed, and other ingredients that Korakai carried to his family's tavern. There, his father would cook and brew specialties both Tien and Avistani, many a mix of both. The tavern soon became a bustling place for sailors in port, and as Korakai took orders and carried drinks, he'd catch wind of stories from distant lands that he longed to see for himself.</p>\n<p>Every so often, sailors would complain of ill winds or other troubles, and wonder whether the superstitions that tengu could ward off bad luck were true. Whenever they'd ask, Korakai's father would interject, \"Kora, go tell your grandfather someone's here for him.\" The old tengu with the faded feathers was well known among the sailors for his raucous stories and his rituals to dispel misfortune. Though Korakai suspected that much of the time, his grandfather was putting on a show, he knew that whenever the older tengu asked for his \"walking stick\"—a khakkhara, a ringed prayer staff that had been in the family for generations—what followed would be nothing less than a glimpse of old Kwanlai. As his grandfather glided in a whirling dance over the deck of a ship, magical feather fan in one hand and staff in the other, even Korakai's clumsy grasp of the Tengu language could catch words of power amid the chiming of the staff's rings.</p>\n<p>One day, Korakai demanded to go with his grandfather out on the seas. A ferry needed to cross the channel to Kortos for much-needed medicines, despite signs of a storm, and the captain wanted a tengu on board. At first, it seemed like they would evade the worst, but the sea changes in the blink of an eye. A rogue gust pitched the vessel, almost knocking Korakai overboard, and he reached out with his hand for purchase, finding the end of his grandfather's staff. For a moment, he clutched the staff, his grandfather holding the other end—then, the heirloom snapped. Korakai's hand came away with broken metal, and as the khakkhara's rings scattered into the raging sea, Korakai fell with them. The taste of salt assailed his open beak.</p>\n<p>The light from the surface growing distant, Korakai glimpsed a shadow moving through the water toward him: a feathered shape, drinking gourd in one hand. Korakai reached his hand out for help, but the figure was swept away in a twin current of air and water, and Korakai could have sworn he saw a bearded man and a long-haired woman in the spiraling riptide. Again, Korakai tried to swim toward the currents, but again, shadows clashed together—a serpentine creature with a mane of lightning and a pearl-scaled sailfish battled a dragon with salt talons and an invisible force that churned the water into a glaring eye. Blasted back by their conflict, Korakai resigned himself to his fate and sank into the depths.</p>\n<p>He fell for minutes, for hours, for an eternity, the surface a distant memory. Against flashes of lightning that had no right shining this far down, Korakai glimpsed gods, spirits, and more primordial things. Yet he saw that each shape, no matter how powerful, always coalesced from the same elements, and always returned to them once their business was done. In that moment, Korakai understood something, and with a peal of thunder, he broke the surface of the water.</p>\n<p>On deck, Korakai coughed out seawater. The storm had ended, and though the sails were torn, the crew was miraculously unharmed. The sailors cheered for Korakai's grandfather, thinking he had warded off the tempest, but the two tengu knew that it was no jinx-eating superstition to thank, but something deeper; the storm hadn't passed at all, it had come to reside within Korakai. As he released his grip on the now-broken staff, sparks danced between his talons.</p>\n<p>In the years that followed, Korakai learned how to channel and direct—never command—the powers he had discovered in the tempest. As his grandfather grew older, Korakai helped more and more with the elder tengu's duties, and when he passed peacefully in his sleep one spring evening, sailors came from far and wide to witness Korakai return his ashes to the sea, each ship releasing a paper lantern to float across the waves in his memory. Not long thereafter, Korakai decided to leave the island. His parents were supportive; after all, they had crossed half of Golarion once before, why should they object to their son doing the same? Taking up his grandfather's broken staff, Korakai boarded the next ship out, trading the promise of good luck for passage to distant ports.</p>\n<p>Now, Korakai wanders the world with nothing more than the desire to see new sights and collect new experiences, above all hoping to one day visit Kwanlai for himself.

You are a spellcaster, and you can cast spells of the arcane tradition using the Cast a Spell activity. As a wizard, when you cast spells, your incantations likely specify exactly what forces you call on and how to shape them, and your gestures precisely shape and direct your magic while circles of arcane runes flare to life.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook (see below), as well as one extra curriculum cantrip and one extra curriculum spell of each rank you can cast from your arcane school. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a wizard, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in the Wizard Spells per Day table.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Intelligence, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Intelligence modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear on page 403.</p>\n<h2>Heightening Spells</h2>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks.</p>\n<h2>Cantrips</h2>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of wizard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level wizard, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level wizard, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p>\n<h2>Spellbook</h2>\n<p>Every arcane spell has a written version, which you record in your personalized book of spells. You start with a spellbook worth 10 sp or less, which you receive for free and must study each day to prepare your spells. Your spellbook's form and name are up to you. It might be a musty, leather-bound tome or an assortment of thin metal disks connected to a brass ring; its name might be esoteric, like <em>The Tome of Silent Shadows</em> or something more academic, like <em>Advanced Pyromantic Applications of Jalmeri Elemental Theory</em>.</p>\n<p>The spellbook contains your choice of 10 arcane cantrips and five 1st-rank arcane spells.

You also add two 1st-rank spells from the curriculum of your arcane school (except in the case of the school of unified magical theory, as described in that school).</p>\n<p>Each time you gain a level, you add two arcane spells to your spellbook, of any spell rank for which you have spell slots, chosen from common spells of your tradition or others you gain access to and learn via Learn a Spell.

In other cases, there's never a choice at all—being raised on the streets leaves few other options available for those who do not wish to become criminals. Rarest are those who come to adventuring late in life.</p>\n<p>This was Ezren's path to adventure. Born to a successful spice merchant in one of Absalom's more affluent districts, Ezren's childhood was pleasantly safe. As the fourth of six siblings, he never knew the responsibility implicit in being the eldest (and therefore the one expected to carry on father's trade) or the freedom of being the youngest. He enjoyed the comforts of a well-to-do family, lived in a neighborhood relatively safe from crime, and seemed poised for a life of mediocrity.</p>\n<p>That changed when his father was taken away, charged with heresy by the church of Abadar. The charges were too spurious to stick, and while his father escaped excommunication, the damage had been done—his father's business fell to pieces. Shocked, dismayed, and convinced that his father was innocent, Ezren abandoned his future and spent his adult life trying to repair his father's ruined reputation. So when Ezren finally uncovered irrefutable proof of his father's guilt, and he realized he'd wasted his life on a lie, he turned his evidence over to the church and said goodbye to his home, his family, and his life.</p>\n<p>At the age of 42, Ezren is full aware that he's missed his adulthood, yet at the same time he looks forward to discovering the world, and making a difference for a cause that he believes in. His dissatisfaction with family, religion, and government left him precious little to trust but his own intellect—in fighting for his father's redemption, he had become a gifted researcher, scholar, and intellectual. Lacking the spry limbs of youth, the trust in religion, the strong arm of the soldier, or the way with words of the politician, Ezren felt he had but one option open. He traveled to tarnished Oppara, capital of Taldor and one of the oldest cities of the continent of Avistan, hoping to join one of several prestigious schools of wizardry. Yet time and time again, he was turned away due to his age. No wizard seemed to want an apprentice who, in many cases, was older than them. So Ezren was forced to strike out on his own once again.</p>\n<p>Over the next decade, as he traveled Avistan, Ezren studied where he could, picking up tricks of the wizard's trade here and there. The combination of arcane study mixed with his worldly first-hand experiences have given him an edge over young wizards fresh out of apprenticeship and eager to make names for themselves. Ezren knows about the many ways the world can trick and betray you, but now he's finally begun to master the art of magic, giving him the tools to fight back.</p>","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/deity.svg","value":""},"ethnicity":{"value":"Varisian"},"gender":{"value":"M/He/Him"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"languages":{"details":"","value":["draconic","dwarven","halfling","sakvroth","varisian"]},"level":{"value":5},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"focus":{"value":1},"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":1},"arcana":{"rank":2},"athletics":{"rank":0},"crafting":{"rank":1},"deception":{"rank":0},"diplomacy":{"rank":2},"intimidation":{"rank":0},"medicine":{"rank":0},"nature":{"rank":1},"occultism":{"rank":1},"performance":{"rank":0},"religion":{"rank":1},"society":{"rank":2},"stealth":{"rank":0},"survival":{"rank":1},"thievery":{"rank":0}},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.iconics.Actor.XI1j0hr3An6W5gAe"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"YgjgK1RWBfBpyifw","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/iconics/YoonFull.webp","items":[{"_id":"GLbRpGniarZwqoUM","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.ancestries.Item.IiG7DgeLWYrSNXuX"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/alternatives/ancestries/human.svg","name":"Human","sort":0,"system":{"additionalLanguages":{"count":1,"custom":"","value":[]},"boosts":{"0":{"selected":"dex","value":["cha","con","dex","int","str","wis"]},"1":{"selected":"con","value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]},"2":{"value":[]}},"description":{"value":"<p><em>As unpredictable and varied as any of Golarion's peoples, humans have exceptional drive and the capacity to endure and expand.

Choose one element to be your kinetic element, and select two 1st-level impulse feats that have that element's trait.</p>\n<p>In addition, you gain an impulse junction, a benefit that occurs when you use an impulse of the chosen element that takes 2 actions or more. This happens before the other effects of the impulse, unless noted otherwise. You can gain only one impulse junction per round; they are described in full below.</p>\n<p><strong>Air</strong> Before or after the other effects of the impulse, you can either Stride up to half your Speed or Step. If you have a fly Speed, you can Fly up to half your fly Speed instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Earth</strong> Fragments of stone float around you, granting you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Fire</strong> Increase the damage die size of fire damage dealt by the impulse by one step.</p>\n<p><strong>Metal</strong> Choose acid, electricity, or piercing. Until the start of your next turn, each time a creature touches you or damages you with an unarmed melee attack or nonreach melee weapon, it takes damage of the chosen type equal to half your level (minimum 1 damage).</p>\n<p><strong>Water</strong> After the impulse's other effects, you can move one creature targeted by the impulse or in its area 5 feet in any direction, or 10 feet if it's in a body of water. This can't move the creature into the air. You can choose only a creature that's willing to be moved, that failed its save against the impulse, or that you succeeded at an impulse attack roll against.</p>\n<p><strong>Wood</strong> You gain temporary Hit Points equal to your level that last until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<h3><strong>Dual Gate</strong></h3>\n<p>Your kinetic gate is a harmonious conduit between two planes, allowing you to combine their elements to give you a versatile set of abilities. Select two elements to be your kinetic elements. Then, select two 1st-level impulse feats, one with the trait of the first element and one with the trait of the other.</p>"},"level":{"value":1},"location":"vpzUpiomXkVfWxwv","prerequisites":{"value":[]},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Rage of Elements"},"rules":[{"key":"ActiveEffectLike","mode":"override","path":"flags.pf2e.kineticist.elements","priority":19,"value":[]},{"key":"ActiveEffectLike","mode":"override","path":"flags.pf2e.kineticist.gate","priority":49,"value":{"five":null,"four":null,"one":null,"six":null,"three":null,"two":null}},{"adjustName":false,"choices":[{"label":"PF2E.SpecificRule.Kineticist.KineticGate.DualGate.Label","value":"dual-gate"},{"label":"PF2E.SpecificRule.Kineticist.KineticGate.SingleGate","value":"single-gate"}],"flag":"kineticGate","key":"ChoiceSet","prompt":"PF2E.SpecificRule.Kineticist.KineticGate.Prompt.Gate","rollOption":"kinetic-gate:initial","selection":"single-gate"},{"adjustName":false,"choices":{"filter":["item:tag:kineticist-kinetic-gate"]},"flag":"elementOne","key":"ChoiceSet","prompt":"PF2E.SpecificRule.Kineticist.KineticGate.Prompt.Element","rollOption":"kinetic-gate:first-element:fire-gate","selection":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.PfeDtJBJdUun0THS"},{"flag":"fireGate","key":"GrantItem","uuid":"{item|flags.pf2e.rulesSelections.elementOne}"},{"adjustName":false,"choices":{"filter":["item:tag:kineticist-kinetic-gate"]},"flag":"elementTwo","key":"ChoiceSet","predicate":["kinetic-gate:initial:dual-gate"],"prompt":"PF2E.SpecificRule.Kineticist.KineticGate.Prompt.Element","rollOption":"kinetic-gate:second-element"},{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"{item|flags.pf2e.rulesSelections.elementTwo}"},{"domain":"all","key":"RollOption","option":"junction:{item|flags.pf2e.rulesSelections.elementOne}:impulse","predicate":["kinetic-gate:initial:single-gate"]}],"slug":"kinetic-gate","traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["kineticist"]},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"feat","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"p7s3mQcvM2b7wVSE","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.xhCYkt3acfFd0hr2"},"pf2e":{"itemGrants":{"baseKinesis":{"id":"KyrJHddtmPBXdDnt","onDelete":"detach"},"elementalBlast":{"id":"oHFamNSkHOxBbf9l","onDelete":"detach"}}}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/awaken-portal.webp","name":"Impulses","sort":200,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"classfeature","description":{"value":"<p>An impulse is a special type of magical action available to kineticists, allowing them to wield or shape their element into diverse and powerful forms. To wield an element, you must have your kinetic aura active and have a free hand, as described in the impulse trait. You automatically gain the Elemental Blast and Base Kinesis impulses, and your kinetic gate selection gives you additional impulse feats. You can select more impulse feats with kineticist class feats, and at higher levels, you'll automatically get more with the gate's threshold class feature. You can select an impulse feat only if it matches one of your kinetic elements.</p>\n<p>Impulses are magical, and though they aren't spells, some things that affect spells also affect impulses. Abilities that restrict you from casting spells (such as being polymorphed into a battle form) or protect against spells (such as a spell that protects against other spells or a creature's bonus to saves against spells) also apply to impulses.</p>\n<h3><strong>Impulse Levels</strong></h3>\n<p>Any impulse you use is the same level you are. For instance, if you're 5th level, your Elemental Blast would be 5th level (and its counteract rank would be 3rd rank), even though you gained the action at 1st level.</p>\n<p>Similar to spells, many impulses get more powerful as you increase in level. In these cases, the impulse ends with one or more \"Level\" entries. This either lists the levels at which the impulse gets an upgrade or has an entry with a plus sign that describes a benefit that increases on a regular basis. For instance, a 1st-level impulse with a \"Level (+4)\" entry would get stronger at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.</p>\n<h3><strong>Impulse Attacks and DCs</strong></h3>\n<p>An impulse that requires a saving throw uses your kineticist class DC. Some of your impulses require you to attempt an <strong>impulse attack roll</strong> to see how effective they are. Your impulse attack roll uses the same proficiency and attribute modifier as your kineticist class DC. Like a spell attack modifier, your impulse attack modifier uses the following formula: d20 roll + attribute modifier + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties. This means your impulse attack roll is typically 10 lower than your class DC. The @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained} condition can reduce your impulse attack rolls and class DCs. You can acquire a <em>gate attenuator</em> to gain a bonus to your impulse attack modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Elemental Blast</strong></h3>\n<p>The @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.6lbr0Jnv0zMB5uGb]{Elemental Blast} impulse is a simple expression of your power, allowing you to attack with the pure matter of your kinetic element. Though each element has its own strengths and weaknesses, the basic principles to using them are the same. You can customize the appearance of your Elemental Blast and can even choose a different form each time you use the impulse.</p>\n<h3><strong>Base Kinesis</strong></h3>\n<p>The @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.nTBrvt2b9wngyr0i]{Base Kinesis} impulse lets you perform simple alterations to an element.</p>"},"level":{"value":1},"location":"vpzUpiomXkVfWxwv","prerequisites":{"value":[]},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Rage of Elements"},"rules":[{"extends":"kineticist","key":"SpecialStatistic","label":"PF2E.TraitImpulse","slug":"impulse","type":"attack-roll"},{"flag":"elementalBlast","key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.6lbr0Jnv0zMB5uGb"},{"flag":"baseKinesis","key":"GrantItem","predicate":["class:kineticist"],"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.nTBrvt2b9wngyr0i"}],"slug":"impulses","traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["kineticist"]},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"feat","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"pZRuRtjy3f0gDxa3","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.g8QrV39TmZfkbXgE"},"pf2e":{"grantedBy":{"id":"JmdOC2FJ8VLPIROT","onDelete":"cascade"}}},"img":"icons/magic/water/vortex-water-whirlpool.webp","name":"Channel Elements","sort":28700000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"action"},"actions":{"value":1},"category":"offensive","description":{"value":"<p><strong>Requirements</strong> Your kinetic gate isn't active.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You tap into your kinetic gate to make elements flow around you.

To many barbarians, brute force is a hammer and every problem looks like a nail, whereas others try to hold back the storm of emotions inside them and release their rage only when it matters most.</em></p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.journals.JournalEntry.kzxu2dI7tFxv6Ix6.JournalEntryPage.lvuutBI9BSCU6cWe]{Barbarian}</p>"},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"hp":12,"items":{"23vme":{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/greater-juggernaut.webp","level":13,"name":"Greater Juggernaut","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.TuL0UfqH14MtqYVh"},"3gwvw":{"img":"icons/skills/melee/strike-axe-blood-red.webp","level":5,"name":"Brutality","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.EEUTd0jAyfwTLzjk"},"7jt77":{"img":"icons/equipment/chest/breastplate-quilted-brown.webp","level":13,"name":"Medium Armor Expertise","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.FCEp9jjxxgRJDJV3"},"8ibv2":{"img":"icons/magic/symbols/symbol-lightning-bolt.webp","level":9,"name":"Lightning Reflexes","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.TUOeATt52P43r5W0"},"blnv0":{"img":"icons/creatures/eyes/human-single-brown.webp","level":17,"name":"Heightened Senses","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.7MhzrbOyue5GQsck"},"e0sur":{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/indomitable-will.webp","level":15,"name":"Indomitable Will","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.BZnqKnqKVImjSIFE"},"g3k30":{"img":"icons/magic/air/wind-vortex-swirl-red.webp","level":17,"name":"Quick Rage","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.qMtyQGUllPdgpzUo"},"gfxqm":{"img":"icons/creatures/mammals/bull-horned-blue.webp","level":7,"name":"Juggernaut","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.OMZs5y16jZRW9KQK"},"ihbgk":{"img":"icons/skills/melee/shield-damaged-broken-orange.webp","level":19,"name":"Devastator","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.VLiT503OLOM3vaDx"},"njgcl":{"img":"icons/skills/melee/hand-grip-sword-orange.webp","level":15,"name":"Greater Weapon Specialization (Barbarian)","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.7JjhxMFo8DMwpGx0"},"o4ypa":{"img":"icons/skills/melee/blade-tip-chipped-blood-red.webp","level":13,"name":"Weapon Fury","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.ejP4jVQkS48uKRFz"},"p941e":{"img":"icons/environment/settlement/watchtower-silhouette-yellow.webp","level":3,"name":"Deny Advantage","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.PNpmVmD21zViDtGC"},"qh9xw":{"img":"icons/magic/symbols/mask-yellow-orange.webp","level":11,"name":"Mighty Rage","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.88Q33X2a0iYPkbzd"},"s5lxl":{"img":"icons/tools/smithing/furnace-fire-metal-orange.webp","level":19,"name":"Armor of Fury","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.QTCIahokREpnAYDi"},"spb04":{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/weapon-specialization.webp","level":7,"name":"Weapon Specialization","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.9EqIasqfI8YIM3Pt"},"tp5pg":{"img":"icons/skills/social/intimidation-impressing.webp","level":9,"name":"Raging Resistance","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.ie6xDX9GMEcA2Iuq"},"uhbeo":{"img":"icons/magic/symbols/question-stone-yellow.webp","level":1,"name":"Instinct","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.dU7xRpg4kFd01hwZ"},"xvavy":{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/rage.webp","level":1,"name":"Rage","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.WZUCvxqbigXos1L9"}},"keyAbility":{"value":["str"]},"perception":2,"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Core Rulebook"},"rules":[],"savingThrows":{"fortitude":2,"reflex":1,"will":2},"skillFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"skillIncreaseLevels":{"value":[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]},"slug":"barbarian","spellcasting":0,"trainedSkills":{"additional":3,"value":["athletics"]},"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":[]},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"class","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"XmCojpjLEJcaP4Pe","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.dU7xRpg4kFd01hwZ"},"pf2e":{"itemGrants":{"giantInstinct":{"id":"FTnAtdmiFcU6SKKf","onDelete":"detach"}}}},"img":"icons/magic/symbols/question-stone-yellow.webp","name":"Instinct","sort":0,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"classfeature","description":{"value":"<p>You channel your rage through an instinct.

The natives of this brutal land are the nomadic Kellids, and they have made the best of this primal world. Amiri is one of these barbarians. Although she was blessed with a combination of independence and brawn, Amiri's childhood remained one of constant challenge. To the people of her tribe, the Six Bears, brawn and bravery were not ideal characteristics for a woman to have. To the Six Bears, a woman's role was simple—raise children, tend to the sick, and forge bonds with other tribes. Women were resources. When a tribe wished to form an alliance, they would send gifts of meat, furs, treasure, and daughters. Amiri didn't see herself as livestock, and every chance she got, she tried to one-up her brothers and cousins. When a hunter went out and caught a caribou for the tribe, she would go out and catch two. When a party of orc raiders stumbled into their hunting grounds and a tribal hero killed four, she took it upon herself to kill six. Her constant sense of competition made her few friends—her brothers were both intimidated by her ferocity and enthralled by her beauty, while her sisters knew that each time she went against tradition, they would all be punished.</p>\n<p>When Amiri finally came of age, her reputation had spread beyond the Six Bears. The other tribes took to calling her the \"Soft Chieftain\" of the Six Bears, a name that humiliated her almost as much as it did her kin, inferring that they were weak for allowing one of their women to grow so independent and strong. None of the other tribes wanted any part of her—her continued presence among the Six Bears caused much strife between once friendly tribes, and so the elders determined that there was but one choice—Amiri had to die. The only problem was the commonly held belief that murder of one's kin was the greatest taboo and the surest path to Hell.</p>\n<p>The opportunity to be rid of their troublesome sister rose soon enough, when word came of a tribe of frost giants who had been sighted in the nearby mountains. The elders organized a warband to scout the mountains and to drive back the giants, and they made sure that Amiri was included in the band. Shocked but proud to have finally been chosen, Amiri didn't notice how the elders smiled at her eagerness to be on her way. The elders knew that Amiri's sense of competition would swiftly get her in over her head, and in secret tasked the rest of the hunters to goad her into just such a situation.</p>\n<p>The warband headed up into the Kodar foothills, and it wasn't long before they found evidence of giants. One morning, the leader of the band rushed into camp, waving a dagger the size of a man's arm over his head. The warrior claimed to have single-handedly slain a giant and to have taken his dagger, and the others in the band congratulated him on his skill and bravery. Amiri took the bait, and announced that she would return by sundown with an even greater weapon. She could have no way of knowing that the dagger was part of the deception—that the warband had brought it with them as a prop to incite her into a foolish plan.</p>\n<p>What the warband themselves didn't anticipate was that Amiri would find a frost giant. After wandering the mountains, she came to an immense body at the foot of a cliff—the giant had fallen to his death weeks before, and at his side lay his immense bastard sword. Although Amiri knew that she had not killed the giant, she also knew that all she needed was his sword as proof—certainly her kin wouldn't think to dispute her claim with such a grand trophy. Yet when she returned to the place she had left her kin, she found the camp empty. Concerned, worried that they had fallen victim to the region's dangers, she tracked them, catching up with the warband halfway back to the tribal camp. As she approached the camp, though, she realized something was amiss—they were talking of her, and they were laughing.</p>\n<p>Creeping unseen to the edge of the camp, she realized that she had been duped. She heard her kin mocking her ways, of how she had fallen for their ruse, and how even now she was likely cooking in a giant's stewpot. That they seemed grateful and so at ease with her death was not what enraged Amiri. It was the proof that her own people thought of her as a fool that did it. Eyes blazing, Amiri stepped into the camp and held her new sword out, proclaiming that even now she had bested them. The other warriors, shocked to see her alive, quickly fell back to laughter, pointing out that she could hardly wield such an ungainly weapon. Her fury growing, Amiri hefted the weapon and tried to adopt a menacing pose, but the weapon's size threw her off balance and she toppled over, much to the other barbarian's growing amusement.</p>\n<p>It was enough. With a roar, Amiri leapt back to her feet. Her rage filled her body, clouded her vision, stole over her soul. Two of the barbarians had been decapitated by her immense sword before they realized that death had come. The battle was swift and brutal, with Amiri not noticing the blows that landed on her, simply stepping from one traitor to the next and cutting them down.</p>\n<p>When her rage finally subsided, Amiri realized what she had done. She knew that the hunters had certainly deserved their fates, but they were still kin. That her reasons for murdering them were, to her, valid didn't change the ties of blood. She knew that she had cut those ties, and so she turned her back on the remains, trusting that they would be discovered by another hunting party soon enough. As she headed west into the lands of Irrisen and the unknown reaches beyond, her heart was for the first time free—no longer was her future tied to traditions that would constrain her. She has come to value her oversized sword, and even though she can only truly wield it properly when her blood rage takes her, it has become as much a part of her as her fierce independence or her fiery heart. She no longer sees herself as a member of the Six Bears, but never speaks of the circumstances that forced her to flee her homeland.

For example, casting a spell to create undead would be anathema to Pharasma, the goddess of death. Many actions that are anathema don't appear in any deity's formal list. For borderline cases, you and your GM determine which acts are anathema.</p>\n<p>If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity.

Known to her faithful as the Dawnflower, the Healing Flame, and the Everlight, she teaches temperance and patience in all things. Compassion and peace are her greatest virtues, and if enemies of the faith can be redeemed, they should be. Yet there are those who have no interest in redemption, who glory in slaughter and death. From the remorseless evil of the undead and fiends to the cruelties born in the hearts of mortals, Sarenrae's doctrines preach swift justice delivered by the scimitar's edge. To this end, she expects her faithful to be skilled at swordplay, both as a form of martial arts promoting centering of mind and body, and so that when they do enter battle, their foes do not suffer any longer than necessary.</p>\n<p>Her priests are often categorized into these two camps—those who favor redemption as a method to defeat the enemy, and those who favor the blade. Kyra is certainly one of the latter. Born in a small farming town to loving parents, Kyra grew up in the shadow of one of the Dawnflower's shrines. She was taken at a young age with the beauty of the shrine's stained glass, and the grace of the three priestesses who practiced swordplay on the nearby hill each dawn as they offered their morning prayers. When bandits attacked her small town, Kyra watched as the priestesses did their best to reason with them—and when that came to naught, to end them before they could do more damage. Unfortunately, the bandits were too strong, and the village burned. Kyra was one of the few survivors, and on the smoking ruins of the shrine she swore her life and sword arm to Sarenrae, swore to protect those who could not protect themselves and to not spare the blade when the time for redemption passes.</p>\n<p>Possessed of a fierce will and pride in her faith and skills with the scimitar, Kyra has traveled far since her trial by fire. She lost her family and home that fateful day, yet where another might be consumed by anger and a thirst for revenge, Kyra has found peace in the Everlight, and in the belief that, if she can prevent even one death at evil hands, her own losses will not have been in vain.</p>","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"class":{"value":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/icons/deity/Sarenrae.webp","value":"Saranrae"},"ethnicity":{"value":"Kelish"},"gender":{"value":"F/She/Her"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"languages":{"details":"","value":["common","kelish"]},"level":{"min":1,"value":1},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"focus":{"value":1},"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"rank":0,"value":0},"reflex":{"rank":0,"value":0},"will":{"rank":0,"value":0}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":0},"arcana":{"rank":0},"athletics":{"rank":1},"crafting":{"rank":0},"deception":{"rank":0},"diplomacy":{"rank":1},"intimidation":{"rank":0},"medicine":{"rank":1},"nature":{"rank":0},"occultism":{"rank":0},"performance":{"rank":1},"religion":{"rank":0},"society":{"rank":0},"stealth":{"rank":0},"survival":{"rank":0},"thievery":{"rank":0}},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.iconics.Actor.yoAU5rWYH4KJGPr5"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"yU4m6Ameqs3NLsNH","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/iconics/FumbusFull.webp","items":[{"_id":"1l2npffcrfag31pe","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.backgrounds.Item.j9v38iHA0sVy59SR"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/background.svg","name":"Pathfinder Hopeful","sort":0,"system":{"boosts":{"0":{"selected":"int","value":["con","int"]},"1":{"selected":"dex","value":["cha","con","dex","int","str","wis"]}},"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong> Region - Absalom and Starstone Isle</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've long wanted to join the adventurous Pathfinder Society.

The Chitterwood has been largely left to the goblins since the end of the Goblinblood Wars nearly twenty years ago, its goblin inhabitants now free of the militant influence of their hobgoblin cousins, most of whom were eradicated or driven out of Isger at the closing of the war.</p>\n<p>Fumbus had the honor of serving as apprentice to the Fire-Eater goblin clan's chief pickle-maker, a position which gave him a fair amount of standing amongst his kin. Unfortunately, Fumbus had a particular penchant for experimentation that led to spectacular failures as often as it led to new delicacies. When a particularly unstable batch of \"spicy pickle brine\" exploded in the middle of the Fire-Eater encampment, Fumbus fled the Chitterwood, fearing that the reprisal from his fellow goblins for destroying both the clan's precious pickle barrel and a significant supply of cucumbers would be swift and violent.</p>\n<p>Fumbus's initial forays into the wider world were truly terrifying. Scavenging from human farms usually ended poorly, as vicious dogs and horrifying horses would bite, chase, or stomp the poor goblin if they caught wind of his presence. The humans themselves were often even more terrifying, and Fumbus found himself fleeing pitchfork-wielding mobs with stolen, smelly shoes (easiest to find without a light and useful as either food or clothing) tucked under one arm far more often than he found a safe place to fill his belly and sleep. Fumbus's life likely would have ended at the hands of one of these mobs had he not encountered a passing half-orc Pathfinder named Droven whose initial reaction to the little goblin was humor, rather than fear or violence. Used to dealing with a certain amount of prejudice and distrust himself, Droven dissuaded the mob from pursuing their vendetta against the goblin and allowed Fumbus to accompany him on his mission.</p>\n<p>Droven's heroics entranced young Fumbus, particularly the alchemical fire and other concoctions the half-orc used to defeat his opponents. When Droven completed his mission for the Pathfinder Society, he brought Fumbus back with him to Absalom. Droven helped secure a home for the little goblin in the Puddles district, where Fumbus's presence would be less likely to cause a stir, and shared what he knew of alchemy with the eager goblin. While Fumbus was terrified at the thought of needing to write down formulas, his mind was sharp and he quickly mastered the art of reading; to Fumbus, collecting these foolishly discarded thoughts was no different than surviving off the trash and scraps left on the outskirts of towns and cities. Fumbus came up with his own system for creating and remembering formulas using small tokens engraved with pictographic runes and a series of leather cords, which he would use to bind certain ingredients in specific orders. Together these implements allowed him to practice alchemy without risking his goblin soul or precious thoughts by performing the obscene act of writing anything down. Of further benefit to Fumbus, his new home's location in the Puddles allows the little goblin to experiment with all manner of inflammable and unstable concoctions with little fear of wreaking destruction beyond the building's water-logged rooms.</p>\n<p>Droven offered to sponsor Fumbus into the Pathfinder Society, but the goblin was so impressed by Droven that he truly believed he would not be able to pass the Society's rigorous entry exams. Determined to prove himself, Fumbus busily applied his time and energy to creating new alchemical formulas and perfecting his system for recording his discoveries. As Fumbus's confidence grew, he began to believe that perhaps he might find a place in the Pathfinder Society after all. Skulking through the alleys of Absalom, Fumbus made his way to the Grand Lodge. Upon his arrival, Fumbus learned that Droven had left on a mission several weeks ago and was overdue to report in; his ship was believed lost at sea. Droven had left a letter of sponsorship as well as some funds to secure the goblin a chance to learn at the Society's institutions but Fumbus was unwilling to begin his training without the half-orc present.</p>\n<p>Months have passed and Droven has still not returned. Fumbus spends his time perfecting his alchemy, seeking news of his lost friend, and looking for opportunities to ingratiate himself to the Pathfinder Society, despite multiple assurances from the Society's members and leadership that Fumbus's welcome was already secured by his half-orc friend. Something in Fumbus's mind refuses to let go of the idea that he must prove himself to be a worthy explorer of the same caliber as Droven, whose heroics and skill are unmatched in Fumbus's view. The little goblin has made a decision that he holds sacrosanct: he will earn his entrance to the Society by either finding his friend Droven and bringing the half-orc home, or by performing a truly heroic act worthy of the reputation Droven holds in Fumbus's own eyes.</p>","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/deity.svg","value":""},"ethnicity":{"value":""},"gender":{"value":"M/He/Him"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"languages":{"details":"","value":["draconic","jotun","orcish","osiriani"]},"level":{"value":5},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"crafting":{"infusedReagents":{"value":2}},"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":1},"arcana":{"rank":0},"athletics":{"rank":1},"crafting":{"rank":2},"deception":{"rank":0},"diplomacy":{"rank":1},"intimidation":{"rank":0},"medicine":{"rank":1},"nature":{"rank":0},"occultism":{"rank":0},"performance":{"rank":0},"religion":{"rank":0},"society":{"rank":0},"stealth":{"rank":2},"survival":{"rank":1},"thievery":{"rank":1}},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.iconics.Actor.yU4m6Ameqs3NLsNH"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"ywdeyJ0CMWLEGRGI","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/iconics/HarskFull.webp","items":[{"_id":"i49QhtMMGL3swBxM","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/lore.svg","name":"Forest Lore","sort":0,"system":{"description":{"value":""},"mod":{"value":0},"proficient":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"lore","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"mL5VYLWWrv7HO3yu","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.ancestries.Item.BYj5ZvlXZdpaEgA6"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/alternatives/ancestries/dwarf.svg","name":"Dwarf","sort":0,"system":{"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"custom":"","value":["gnomish","goblin","jotun","orcish","petran","sakvroth"]},"boosts":{"0":{"value":["con"]},"1":{"value":["wis"]},"2":{"selected":"str","value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"description":{"value":"<p><em>Dwarves have a well-earned reputation as a stoic and stern people, ensconced within citadels and cities carved from solid rock.

As a young dwarf, Harsk spent every spare moment outdoors under the wide skies of southeastern Varisia, particularly at night beneath the stars, where his keen vision made him a hunter without compare. While generally uninterested in his family's traditional smithing, he still inherited enough of their tinkering ability to construct his own crossbow, a heavy, highly accurate weapon that few others are able to wind. Eschewing the company of his fellows, few things made Harsk happier than crouching in a tree stand with his bow, listening to the wind through the forest leaves and waiting for deer or larger prey to wander by.</p>\n<p>That all changed twenty years ago, when his elder brother, a fine captain named Sigur, led a dwarven war band from Janderhoff against a small party of giants that had descended from the Mindspin Mountains to raid and pillage. Out of affection, Sigur offered his less-experienced sibling the chance to come and prove himself as Sigur's chief scout and second-in-command. Calm and peaceful by nature, Harsk turned him down, failing to see the honor his brother was doing him until several days after the company had departed. Traveling light and fast, Harsk caught up with his brother quickly—but not quickly enough. Misjudging the size and skill of the raiding party, Sigur led his band into an ambush, where it was slaughtered to the last dwarf.</p>\n<p>With his brother's blood still fresh on his hands, Harsk went mad with rage. That night, he stalked through the giants' camp like a vengeful wraith, slaughtering giant after giant with his crossbow before melting back into the forest, only to reappear elsewhere and take another victim. When the last giant was left gurgling in the dust, Harsk took up his brother's axe and slipped off into the trees, vowing to forever be the voice of justice in the wild places, to keep balance and prevent the sacrifices of noble men like his brother.</p>\n<p>Harsk, like many of his kind, is gruff and taciturn, but there ends most of his connection to dwarven society. Something of a loner, he prefers to spend his time outdoors, communing with nature, though he occasionally travels alongside others whose goals match his own. Uninterested in the beer and ale that so characterize dwarves in the minds of human society, Harsk instead drinks pot after pot of strong tea to keep his senses sharp. While he never lets his brother's axe out of his sight, he wields it only as a last resort, knowing that his true skills lie in the hunt and striking from darkness.</p>","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/deity.svg","value":""},"ethnicity":{"value":""},"gender":{"value":"M/He/Him"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"dex"},"languages":{"details":"","value":[]},"level":{"value":3},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":1},"arcana":{"rank":0},"athletics":{"rank":1},"crafting":{"rank":1},"deception":{"rank":0},"diplomacy":{"rank":0},"intimidation":{"rank":1},"medicine":{"rank":0},"nature":{"rank":0},"occultism":{"rank":0},"performance":{"rank":0},"religion":{"rank":0},"society":{"rank":0},"stealth":{"rank":1},"survival":{"rank":2},"thievery":{"rank":0}},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.iconics.Actor.ywdeyJ0CMWLEGRGI"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"z5u8KDovE01nMfhm","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/iconics/KyraFull.webp","items":[{"_id":"CpcTGfkN7cXZH1Ig","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.backgrounds.Item.CAjQrHZZbALE7Qjy"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/background.svg","name":"Acolyte","sort":900000,"system":{"boosts":{"0":{"selected":"wis","value":["int","wis"]},"1":{"selected":"cha","value":["cha","con","dex","int","str","wis"]}},"description":{"value":"<p>You spent your early days in a religious monastery or cloister.

If you \"can be\" holy or unholy according to your deity, you make that choice, and if you \"must be\" holy or unholy you gain the trait automatically. If you gain the opposing trait in some way, you lose the previous trait until you complete an atone ritual.</p>\n<h2>Anathema</h2>\n<p>Acts fundamentally opposed to your deity's ideals are anathema to your faith. Learning or casting spells, committing acts, and using items that are anathema to your deity remove you from your deity's good graces.</p>\n<p>Casting spells with the unholy trait is almost always anathema to deities who don't allow unholy sanctification, and casting holy spells is likewise anathema to those who don't allow holy sanctification. Similarly, casting spells that are anathema to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your connection to your deity. For example, casting a spell to create undead would be anathema to Pharasma, the goddess of death. Many actions that are anathema don't appear in any deity's formal list. For borderline cases, you and your GM determine which acts are anathema.</p>\n<p>If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. The class features that you lose are determined by the GM, but they likely include your divine font and all cleric spellcasting. These abilities can be regained only if you repent by conducting an atone ritual.</p>"},"level":{"value":1},"location":"n0WxcFdCSUTTXxsc","prerequisites":{"value":[]},"publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Player Core"},"rules":[{"choices":{"filter":[{"or":["item:category:deity","item:category:pantheon"]}],"itemType":"deity"},"flag":"deity","key":"ChoiceSet","predicate":[{"not":"deity"}],"prompt":"PF2E.SpecificRule.Prompt.Deity","selection":"Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.BNycwu3I21dTh4D9"},{"allowDuplicate":false,"flag":"sarenrae","key":"GrantItem","predicate":[{"not":"deity"}],"uuid":"{item|flags.pf2e.rulesSelections.deity}"},{"adjustName":false,"choices":[{"label":"PF2E.TraitHoly","predicate":[{"or":["deity:primary:sanctification:can:holy","deity:primary:sanctification:must:holy"]}],"value":"holy"},{"label":"PF2E.TraitUnholy","predicate":[{"or":["deity:primary:sanctification:can:unholy","deity:primary:sanctification:must:unholy"]}],"value":"unholy"},{"label":"PF2E.NoneOption","predicate":[{"nor":["deity:primary:sanctification:must:holy","deity:primary:sanctification:must:unholy"]}],"value":"none"}],"flag":"sanctification","key":"ChoiceSet","predicate":[{"nor":["deity:primary:sanctification:none","sanctification:holy","sanctification:unholy"]}],"prompt":"PF2E.SpecificRule.Prompt.Sanctification","rollOption":"sanctification","selection":"holy","slug":"sanctification"},{"add":["holy"],"key":"ActorTraits","predicate":["sanctification:holy"]},{"add":["unholy"],"key":"ActorTraits","predicate":["sanctification:unholy"]},{"fist":true,"key":"Strike","predicate":["deity:primary:favored-weapon:fist"]},{"key":"ActiveEffectLike","mode":"upgrade","path":"flags.pf2e.favoredWeaponRank","predicate":["class:cleric"],"value":1}],"slug":"deity","traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["cleric"]},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"feat","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"W7OHdSKSLmJAOlUC","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.AvNbdGSOTWNRgcxs"}},"img":"icons/weapons/axes/axe-double-gold.webp","name":"Cleric Spellcasting","sort":0,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"classfeature","description":{"value":"<p>Your deity bestows on you the power to cast divine spells.

Since your key attribute is Wisdom, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<h2>Heightening Spells</h2>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks.</p>\n<h2>Cantrips</h2>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of cleric spell slot you have.

Known to her faithful as the Dawnflower, the Healing Flame, and the Everlight, she teaches temperance and patience in all things. Compassion and peace are her greatest virtues, and if enemies of the faith can be redeemed, they should be. Yet there are those who have no interest in redemption, who glory in slaughter and death. From the remorseless evil of the undead and fiends to the cruelties born in the hearts of mortals, Sarenrae's doctrines preach swift justice delivered by the scimitar's edge. To this end, she expects her faithful to be skilled at swordplay, both as a form of martial arts promoting centering of mind and body, and so that when they do enter battle, their foes do not suffer any longer than necessary.</p>\n<p>Her priests are often categorized into these two camps—those who favor redemption as a method to defeat the enemy, and those who favor the blade. Kyra is certainly one of the latter. Born in a small farming town to loving parents, Kyra grew up in the shadow of one of the Dawnflower's shrines. She was taken at a young age with the beauty of the shrine's stained glass, and the grace of the three priestesses who practiced swordplay on the nearby hill each dawn as they offered their morning prayers. When bandits attacked her small town, Kyra watched as the priestesses did their best to reason with them—and when that came to naught, to end them before they could do more damage. Unfortunately, the bandits were too strong, and the village burned. Kyra was one of the few survivors, and on the smoking ruins of the shrine she swore her life and sword arm to Sarenrae, swore to protect those who could not protect themselves and to not spare the blade when the time for redemption passes.</p>\n<p>Possessed of a fierce will and pride in her faith and skills with the scimitar, Kyra has traveled far since her trial by fire. She lost her family and home that fateful day, yet where another might be consumed by anger and a thirst for revenge, Kyra has found peace in the Everlight, and in the belief that, if she can prevent even one death at evil hands, her own losses will not have been in vain.</p>","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"class":{"value":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/icons/deity/Sarenrae.webp","value":"Saranrae"},"ethnicity":{"value":"Kelish"},"gender":{"value":"F/She/Her"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"languages":{"details":"","value":["common","kelish"]},"level":{"min":1,"value":5},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"focus":{"value":1},"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"rank":0,"value":0},"reflex":{"rank":0,"value":0},"will":{"rank":0,"value":0}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":0},"arcana":{"rank":0},"athletics":{"rank":1},"crafting":{"rank":0},"deception":{"rank":0},"diplomacy":{"rank":1},"intimidation":{"rank":0},"medicine":{"rank":2},"nature":{"rank":0},"occultism":{"rank":0},"performance":{"rank":1},"religion":{"rank":2},"society":{"rank":0},"stealth":{"rank":0},"survival":{"rank":0},"thievery":{"rank":0}},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.iconics.Actor.z5u8KDovE01nMfhm"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"zIawtsJlKpL28XGS","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/iconics/SajanFull.webp","items":[{"_id":"v6gdqk1v1h99mmac","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.hFBwsVcSnNCJoimo"},"pf2e":{"itemGrants":{}}},"img":"icons/environment/people/group.webp","name":"Versatile Heritage","sort":0,"system":{"ancestry":{"name":"Human","slug":"human","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.ancestries.Item.IiG7DgeLWYrSNXuX"},"description":{"value":"<p>Humanity's versatility and ambition have fueled its ascendance to be the most common ancestry in most nations throughout the world.

Strict padaprajna discipline forged a tight bond between the twins, who spent even their infrequent times of rest together, practicing the latest martial techniques taught to them. On their twelfth birthday, the twins were forcefully separated: Sajan went to live with the fighting men of the ghana padaprajna, while Sajni joined the battling women of the sastra padaprajna. Despite their separation, the twins continued to meet when they could, sparring and joking as they had in their childhoods.</p>\n<p>As the insightful narrative of the <em>Vigrahin Patitraka</em> states, \"A warrior's life is to war.\" Thus it was that Sajan's lord embroiled himself in a conflict with a neighbor. Most of the army fielded by Sajan's lord consisted of conscripts wielding tools of their trades, while the valuable padaprajna watched the battle in reserve. The warriors deduced quickly that they stood on the losing side, but they were duty-bound to fight to the death when instructed. Instead, their lord stole from them the glory of battle-death when he sued for peace after his conscripts fled the field. As part of his surrender, the lord gave over half of his sastra padapranja—including young Sajni.</p>\n<p>Distraught, Sajan returned to his barracks in tears (for which he received severe beatings from his own father), and vowed that night to be reunited with his sister. Several weeks passed before he found his opportunity for escape. He fled into the countryside and slipped stealthily into the city of Sumadhadra, through whose gates Sajan watched his sister pass. After several days of clumsily seeking information on his sister, he finally discovered that all the traded sastra padapranja were loaded onto ships bound for distant Jalmeray.</p>\n<p>Sajan quickly hired himself as a guard aboard a ship bound for the far-away island, and several months later he found himself on its heavily guarded docks. Within a week, Sajan uncovered the fates of most of the sastra padapranja, who worked as guards and courtiers for the island's thakur. Sajni was not among them. More weeks passed before Sajan learned that his sister had, like him, signed on as a guard aboard a trading ship—hers bound for a place called Absalom.</p>\n<p>The desperate young padapranja gained passage to Absalom and, upon arrival, stared in wonder at its size and splendor. It seemed to him that the strange western barbarians he found himself among were incapable of a place so grand. By the time he found his bearings and rejoined his search, however, he found himself without leads, for the sheer size that so impressed him also made finding his sister nearly impossible.</p>\n<p>Sajan knows he cannot return to Vudra, for the padapranja there would execute him as a deserter. He cares not for his home country, however, and continues to seek out any clue that might point him toward his sister.</p>","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/deity.svg","value":""},"ethnicity":{"value":""},"gender":{"value":"M/He/Him"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"dex"},"languages":{"details":"","value":["vudrani"]},"level":{"value":5},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"proficiencies":{"attacks":{"martial":{"rank":1}}},"resources":{"focus":{"value":1},"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":2},"arcana":{"rank":0},"athletics":{"rank":2},"crafting":{"rank":0},"deception":{"rank":0},"diplomacy":{"rank":1},"intimidation":{"rank":0},"medicine":{"rank":0},"nature":{"rank":0},"occultism":{"rank":0},"performance":{"rank":0},"religion":{"rank":1},"society":{"rank":0},"stealth":{"rank":1},"survival":{"rank":0},"thievery":{"rank":0}},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.iconics.Actor.zIawtsJlKpL28XGS"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"zLOVCrRwZhL46vLI","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/iconics/KorakaiFull.webp","items":[{"_id":"lqgEM7WoDD5ci28s","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.rKV11HWREwjjMIum"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/ancestry/skyborn-tengu.webp","name":"Skyborn Tengu","sort":0,"system":{"ancestry":{"name":"Tengu","slug":"tengu","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.ancestries.Item.18xDKYPDBLEv2myX"},"description":{"value":"<p>Your bones may be especially light, you may be a rare tengu with wings, or your connection to the spirits of wind and sky might be stronger than most, slowing your descent through the air.

When he was but an egg, his family left the tengu homeland of Kwanlai, first trekking west to the port city of Goka before boarding a ship to the Inner Sea in search for a better life. Like many immigrants from Tian Xia, they headed for Absalom; however, where they eventually settled was not the City at the Center of the World, but the nearby Isle of Erran.</p>\n<p>Korakai hatched and grew up on those shores, running barefoot on the beaches and rocks. Each day, his mother would dive beneath the waves, holding her breath to collect shellfish, seaweed, and other ingredients that Korakai carried to his family's tavern. There, his father would cook and brew specialties both Tien and Avistani, many a mix of both. The tavern soon became a bustling place for sailors in port, and as Korakai took orders and carried drinks, he'd catch wind of stories from distant lands that he longed to see for himself.</p>\n<p>Every so often, sailors would complain of ill winds or other troubles, and wonder whether the superstitions that tengu could ward off bad luck were true. Whenever they'd ask, Korakai's father would interject, \"Kora, go tell your grandfather someone's here for him.\" The old tengu with the faded feathers was well known among the sailors for his raucous stories and his rituals to dispel misfortune. Though Korakai suspected that much of the time, his grandfather was putting on a show, he knew that whenever the older tengu asked for his \"walking stick\"—a khakkhara, a ringed prayer staff that had been in the family for generations—what followed would be nothing less than a glimpse of old Kwanlai. As his grandfather glided in a whirling dance over the deck of a ship, magical feather fan in one hand and staff in the other, even Korakai's clumsy grasp of the Tengu language could catch words of power amid the chiming of the staff's rings.</p>\n<p>One day, Korakai demanded to go with his grandfather out on the seas. A ferry needed to cross the channel to Kortos for much-needed medicines, despite signs of a storm, and the captain wanted a tengu on board. At first, it seemed like they would evade the worst, but the sea changes in the blink of an eye. A rogue gust pitched the vessel, almost knocking Korakai overboard, and he reached out with his hand for purchase, finding the end of his grandfather's staff. For a moment, he clutched the staff, his grandfather holding the other end—then, the heirloom snapped. Korakai's hand came away with broken metal, and as the khakkhara's rings scattered into the raging sea, Korakai fell with them. The taste of salt assailed his open beak.</p>\n<p>The light from the surface growing distant, Korakai glimpsed a shadow moving through the water toward him: a feathered shape, drinking gourd in one hand. Korakai reached his hand out for help, but the figure was swept away in a twin current of air and water, and Korakai could have sworn he saw a bearded man and a long-haired woman in the spiraling riptide. Again, Korakai tried to swim toward the currents, but again, shadows clashed together—a serpentine creature with a mane of lightning and a pearl-scaled sailfish battled a dragon with salt talons and an invisible force that churned the water into a glaring eye. Blasted back by their conflict, Korakai resigned himself to his fate and sank into the depths.</p>\n<p>He fell for minutes, for hours, for an eternity, the surface a distant memory. Against flashes of lightning that had no right shining this far down, Korakai glimpsed gods, spirits, and more primordial things. Yet he saw that each shape, no matter how powerful, always coalesced from the same elements, and always returned to them once their business was done. In that moment, Korakai understood something, and with a peal of thunder, he broke the surface of the water.</p>\n<p>On deck, Korakai coughed out seawater. The storm had ended, and though the sails were torn, the crew was miraculously unharmed. The sailors cheered for Korakai's grandfather, thinking he had warded off the tempest, but the two tengu knew that it was no jinx-eating superstition to thank, but something deeper; the storm hadn't passed at all, it had come to reside within Korakai. As he released his grip on the now-broken staff, sparks danced between his talons.</p>\n<p>In the years that followed, Korakai learned how to channel and direct—never command—the powers he had discovered in the tempest. As his grandfather grew older, Korakai helped more and more with the elder tengu's duties, and when he passed peacefully in his sleep one spring evening, sailors came from far and wide to witness Korakai return his ashes to the sea, each ship releasing a paper lantern to float across the waves in his memory. Not long thereafter, Korakai decided to leave the island. His parents were supportive; after all, they had crossed half of Golarion once before, why should they object to their son doing the same? Taking up his grandfather's broken staff, Korakai boarded the next ship out, trading the promise of good luck for passage to distant ports.</p>\n<p>Now, Korakai wanders the world with nothing more than the desire to see new sights and collect new experiences, above all hoping to one day visit Kwanlai for himself. Yet even so, he writes home often, sending coin for the tavern when he can, knowing that the beach he grew up on is but an ocean away.</p>","beliefs":"","birthPlace":"","campaignNotes":"","catchphrases":"","dislikes":"","edicts":[],"enemies":"","likes":"","organizations":""},"deity":{"image":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/deity.svg","value":""},"ethnicity":{"value":""},"gender":{"value":"M/He/Him"},"height":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"languages":{"details":"","value":[]},"level":{"value":5},"nationality":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":""},"xp":{"max":1000,"min":0,"pct":0,"value":0}},"exploration":[],"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"pfs":{"characterNumber":null,"currentFaction":"EA","fame":0,"levelBump":false,"playerNumber":null,"reputation":{"EA":0,"GA":0,"HH":0,"RO":0,"VS":0,"VW":0},"school":"none"},"resources":{"focus":{"value":3},"heroPoints":{"max":3,"value":1}},"saves":{},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":0},"arcana":{"rank":0},"athletics":{"rank":1},"crafting":{"rank":1},"deception":{"rank":0},"diplomacy":{"rank":2},"intimidation":{"rank":0},"medicine":{"rank":0},"nature":{"rank":0},"occultism":{"rank":0},"performance":{"rank":0},"religion":{"rank":2},"society":{"rank":0},"stealth":{"rank":0},"survival":{"rank":0},"thievery":{"rank":0}},"_migration":{"version":0.932,"previous":null}},"type":"character","_stats":{"coreVersion":"12.328","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.4.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.iconics.Actor.zLOVCrRwZhL46vLI"},"effects":[]}]
